This program addresses human-ecosystem challenges using a transdisciplinary approach to produce scientific products in partnership with local communities, businesses, industries, scientists, and policy makers, while providing a mechanism to understand and overcome contemporary societal and ecological challenges. Students receive rigorous training in their home disciplines, coupled with training across disciplinary lines and developmental experiences, to prepare them to communicate, collaborate, and innovate in a variety of contexts. Training success is evaluated across measurable competency domains including problem definition, research methods, communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. After 3 years the program expanded relationships across fields and professions, successfully established 18 internship opportunities with community partners, created a new dual-title PhD program open to students in five academic departments, and facilitated the coproduction of knowledge with external partners.

We devised a framework for graduate education that broadens students' skill sets to learn outside their immediate disciplines and think in terms of linked socioecological systems, work in teams, communicate in nonacademic formats, and reflect critically on their own perspectives and actions. The University of Florida's Tropical Conservation and Development program has adopted a learning and action platform that blends theory, skills, and praxis to create an intellectual, social, and professionally safe space where students, faculty, and other participants can creatively address the complex challenges of tropical conservation and development. This platform operates within a nondegree granting program and includes core courses that are taught by a team of biophysical and social scientists. It incorporates a range of alternative learning spaces such as student-led workshops, retreats, visiting professionals, practitioner experiences, and a weekly student-led seminar that collectively encourage students and faculty to enhance their skills and systematically and thoroughly reflect on program activities. Challenges to the described approach include increased service demands on faculty, a redefinition of research excellence to include effective and equitable collaboration with host-country partners, and the trade-offs and uncertainties inherent in more collaborative, interdisciplinary research.

It examines the role these media can play in identity-formation and induction into academic scholarship and professional development. The highly contextualised and situated approach of this study challenges some of the dominant discourses and idealised concepts within the educational technology field to address the significant gap between the potential of web 2.0 and the reality of low rates of adoption and use. The study reconciles social media adoption and use with the self-efficacy and heterogeneity of doctoral practice. By taking an ecological approach, it recognises that doing a PhD requires the negotiation of multiple and interrelated academic and occasionally non-academic contexts. Such an approach legitimises doctoral practice beyond those related purely to thesis-development, and challenges models of doctoral education defined by a trajectory of increased participation and enculturation within a single, localised institutional research community. In addition, rather than focusing on one particular tool or platform, the study adopts a holistic perspective to social media that recognises the multiplicity, interrelatedness and transiency of web 2.0. The empirical research uses a small sample of social sciences, humanities and interdisciplinary PhD students as participants. Adopting a qualitative approach and mixed-method design, data were collected through the observation of online activities across a range of social media, participant-reported accounts, and a series of in-depth participant interviews. Activity theory is used to support a grounded and recursive approach to analysing participant-produced digital artefacts, field notes and interview transcripts through open coding and thick description. From these data, an analytical framework of interrelated object-oriented activity systems was generated with which to identify and describe shifting patterns in social media practice through key phases in the participants' doctoral experiences, and across a range of academic contexts. Emerging findings indicate the role of social media in contributing to, and revealing, the tensions inherent in negotiating multiple and interrelated practice contexts through boundary crossing and interdisciplinary activities. The study reveals how participation in emergent online research networks and communities is enabling new forms of engagement with the research field, often beyond the immediate scope of thesis-related work, and examines how this contributes to the act of mapping the research field by providing additional insights into the socio-cultural infrastructure that underpins academic discourse.

Disease ecology formed as an interdisciplinary field in the 1970s to fill this need and has recently rapidly grown in size and influence. Because interdisciplinary fields integrate diverse scientific expertise and training experiences, understanding their composition and research priorities is often difficult. Here, for the first time, we quantify the composition and educational experiences of a subset of disease ecology practitioners and identify topical trends in published research. We combined a large survey of self-declared disease ecologists with a literature synthesis involving machine-learning topic detection of over 18,500 disease ecology research articles. The number of graduate degrees earned by disease ecology practitioners has grown dramatically since the early 2000s. Similar to other science fields, we show that practitioners in disease ecology have diversified in the last decade in terms of gender identity and institution, with weaker diversification in race and ethnicity. Topic detection analysis revealed how the frequency of publications on certain topics has declined (e.g., HIV, serology), increased (e.g., the dilution effect, infectious disease in bats), remained relatively common (e.g., malaria ecology, influenza, vaccine research and development), or have consistently remained relatively infrequent (e.g., theoretical models, field experiments). Other topics, such as climate change, superspreading, emerging infectious diseases, and network analyses, have recently come to prominence. This study helps identify the major themes of disease ecology and demonstrates how publication frequency corresponds to emergent health and environmental threats.

We reviewed the contents of doctoral theses and publications and synthesized the outcomes of two questionnaire surveys conducted with doctoral candidates and supervisors. A high percentage of the scientific outputs (80%) were interdisciplinary. There was evidence of active collaboration between different teams of doctoral candidates and supervisors, in terms of joint publications (5 papers out of the 69 analyzed) but this was understandably quite limited given the other demands of the program. We found evidence to contradict the perception that interdisciplinarity is a barrier to career success as employment rates were high (97%) and achieved very soon after the defense, both in academia (50%) and the private/public sector (50%) with a strong international dimension. Despite management-oriented research being a limited (9%) portion of the ensemble of theses, employment in management was higher (22%).

To translate SES theory into action, education and training programs are needed that focus on the application of SES approaches across the education and professional spectrum, from K-12 to graduate training to agency management. We developed a training framework that serves sustainability practitioners by building their capacity to apply SES approaches to real world problems and decision-making. The framework uses a SES-based environmental management approach based on a systemic worldview, transdisciplinary thinking, co-development of knowledge, stakeholder engagement, and adaptive governance. The social-ecological systems training and education program (SESTEP or see-step) framework was designed to provide SES training opportunities as a response to the need expressed by senior directors of US federal land management agencies.

Among these, nutrient over-enrichment, resulting in eutrophication, has been a major concern. The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) has initiated public action to improve their water quality and ecosystem state using an approach rooted in restoration ecology. Here we analyze how this has been applied for the coastal lagoons in South France, considering eutrophication as an example of ecosystem degradation and oligotrophication as the corresponding trajectory for ecological restoration of the eutrophied coastal lagoons. Oligotrophication trajectories, initiated by the reduction of external nutrient loading, have resulted in a quick recovery (i.e., within 3 years) of integrative water column variables (Chlorophyll a, total N and P) and phytoplankton. Starting from hypertrophic systems, the oligotrophication trajectory is described by a sequence of three ecosystem states dominated respectively by (i) phytoplankton with bare non-vegetated sediments, (ii) opportunistic macroalgae, (iii) angiosperm and perennial macroalgae, punctuated by regime shifts between these ecosystem states. Nevertheless, the latter regime shift has not been observed for the most degraded ecosystems after 10-years oligotrophication. The N and P accumulated in sediments during eutrophication may also retard the ecological restoration. In shallow freshwater lakes, the phytoplankton-dominated and the angiosperm-dominated states are also characteristic for highly degraded and fully restored ecosystems states, respectively. In contrast, opportunistic macroalgae do not bloom in these systems. Hence, the alternative stable state model, used successfully for these lakes, cannot be applied straightforwardly for coastal lagoons. To be successful, ecological restoration should consider the legislative and societal questions as according the DPSIR framework it typically is a response of society. The conservation-oriented Habitats Directive systematically applies to coastal lagoons and the Birds Directive in some cases as well. The WFD approach is complementary to these more conventional nature conservation approaches. Collectively, local citizens and highly involved stakeholders strongly value the coastal lagoons and attribute very high importance to their regulating ecosystem services (ESs), while differences between stakeholder profiles are related to different perceptions and appreciations of cultural ESs. Hence, coastal lagoon ESs are very important for the different stakeholders and public policies aiming at the ecological restoration of these ecosystems may count on public support.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"De Wit, Rutger/KBD-4717-2024","Le Fur, Ines/0000-0003-2182-2372; Ouisse, Vincent/0000-0003-1755-1354; Derolez, Valerie/0000-0002-6392-971X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2296-701X",NA,NA,NA,NA,"MAY 20",2020,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"108","10.3389/fevo.2020.00108","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2020.00108",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000539217800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Further, most research concerned with this food regime confronts epistemological, methodological, and political limitations to engage with the type of solutions that could lead to transitions to just sustainabilities. Here we review and integrate the findings from scientific literature focused on the ecological, social, or ethical impacts of the corporate food regime, with an emphasis on impacts that operate on a global scale. In addition, we analyze the need for critical science approaches to trigger generative processes for the co-production of uncomfortable, transdisciplinary, actionable knowledges that are fit for designing just and sustainable food regimes. Much of the evidence presented in our analysis is in tension with the interests of the corporate food regime, which fosters decision-making processes based on selective ignorance of the impacts caused by this regime.

Pollution, eutrophication, urbanization, land reclamation; over fishing and exploitation continuously threaten their future. The major challenge that humans face today is managing their use, so that future generations can also enjoy the visual, cultural and edible products that they provide. Such an approach presupposes that all users of the environment share views and are able to communicate wisely on the basis of robust science. The need for conclusive data is pressing. Over the last decade there have been numerous advances in both understanding and approach to estuaries and more and more multidisciplinary studies are now available. The available scientific information has come from a multiplicity of case studies and projects at local and national levels. Regional, international and global programs have been developed; some are being implemented and some are in evolution. However, despite the rapidly increasing knowledge about estuarine ecosystems, crucial questions on the causes of variability and the effects of global change are still poorly understood. Although the perception of politicians and managers of coasts is slowly shifting from a mainly short-term economic approach towards a long-term socio- economic / ecological perspective, there is a need to make existing scientific information much more manageable by non-specialists, without compromising the quality of the information. The Estuaries of the World special session is based on a new book series of the same name, launched recently by Springer. The series gives the opportunity to the scientific community to assemble existing knowledge on essential estuarine sites all around the world.

This article proposes a conceptual pathway to address this challenge through outlining how the SES research contributions of sustainability science and researchers using Elinor Ostrom's diagnostic SES framework (SESF) can integrate and co-benefit from explicitly interlinking their development. From a review of the literature, I outline four key co-benefits from their potential to interlink in the following themes: (1) coevolving SES knowledge types, (2) guiding primary research and assessing sustainability, (3) building a boundary object for transdisciplinary sustainability science, and (4) facilitating comparative analysis. The origins of the SESF include seminal empirical work on common property theory, self-organization, and coupled SES interactions. The SESF now serves as a template for diagnosing sustainability challenges and theorizing explanatory relationships on SES components, interactions, and outcomes within and across case studies. Simultaneously, sustainability science has proposed transdisciplinary research agendas, sustainability knowledge types, knowledge coproduction, and sustainability assessment tools to advance transformative change processes. Key challenges for achieving co-beneficial developments in both communities are discussed in relation to each of the four themes.

Regarding strategy, the competency-based learning model prevails, although most of the learning units continue to be taught with lots of emphasis on the contents. Recently, the concept of andragogy was introduced for postgraduate units and social variant to competencies was established, as well as a playful learning system providing activities outside the classroom and adding variants to the course's instructional design, in the new interdisciplinary doctoral programs. Interdisciplinary has positioned itself as the educational paradigm of the future. There is so much specificity in the different sciences that it is impossible for a teacher or doctoral program to address them with precision and cutting-edge information without having experts in each field. This is the main reason why the IPN now have units for learning social and law sciences, as in the case of environmental and ecological law. Law is a discipline that belongs to the law sciences, while ecology belongs to the biological sciences and environmental sciences to socio-economics. The challenge is: How to teach ecology to a law student, and how to teach law to a future ecologist, all under a certain socioeconomic system? The training thinking in each of the disciplines is very different. Ecological knowledge is immersed in a world of probabilities that give rise to uncertainties not wanted by society or researchers; only by statistical inference can the induction in science be justified; with the scientific method there is no denial that there is a probability of error in the result obtained, but there is certainty that it serves to make the best decision under certain conditions; its central thinking is heuristic. However, when it comes to the law as a set of rules governing social life in a time and place determined (jurisdiction and enforcement of the law), the prevailing thought is hermeneutical. After 10 years of experience in teaching law courses to engineers, biologists and chemists, I found that it is best to generate a civic conscience in their thinking, on every choice they should make, than just teaching principles and norms; significant knowledge was obtained by reviewing case studies on the social and environmental damage produced by certain human acts and misuse of technology. On the other hand, by teaching ecology to sociologists, lawyers and legislators, I understood that their most significant learning is through experience in the fieldwork and reflecting on the fact that we are not the center of the planet but that our actions indeed endanger life as we know it, including our own evolution as a species.

VBDs are dynamically linked to feedbacks between environmental conditions, vector ecology, disease burden, and societal responses that drive transmission. As a result, VBDs have had profound influence on human history. Mechanisms include: (1) killing or debilitating large numbers of people, with demographic and population-level impacts; (2) differentially affecting populations based on prior history of disease exposure, immunity, and resistance; (3) being weaponised to promote or justify hierarchies of power, colonialism, racism, classism and sexism; (4) catalysing changes in ideas, institutions, infrastructure, technologies and social practices in efforts to control disease outbreaks; and (5) changing human relationships with the land and environment.

Motivated by growing recognition of complexity, there have been widespread calls to mix methods, both within and across disciplines, to generate richer scientific understandings and more effective policy interventions. However, bringing methods together often reveals their tacit, inherently contestable, and sometimes directly opposing assumptions about reality and how it can and should be known. There are consequently growing efforts to identify the competencies necessary to work with multiple methods effectively. We identify the ability to recognise and negotiate the ethical-political dimensions of research methods as a key competency in mixed methods, inter- and transdisciplinary, and co-production research, particularly for researchers addressing societal challenges in fields like environment, health and education. We describe these ethical-political dimensions by drawing on our experiences developing an ethics application for a transdisciplinary sustainability science project that brings together the photovoice method and controlled behavioural experiments. The first dimension is that different methods and methodological approaches generate their own ethical standards guiding interactions between researchers and participants that may contradict each other. The second is that these differing ethical standards are directly linked to the variable effects that methods have in wider society (both in terms of their enactment in the moment and the knowledge generated), raising more political questions about the kinds of realities that researchers are contributing to through their chosen methods. We identify the practices that helped us-as two researchers using different methodological approaches-to productively explore these dimensions and enrich our collaborative work.

Long-term field studies are needed to obtain a true understanding of their behavior, life history, ecology, and the selective pressures acting on them. Fortunately, there have been many long-term studies of simians, so a great deal is known about many species.

The movement patterns of an animal provide insight into space use, activity patterns and ecological requirements that are imperative for successful farming and wildlife management practices. Home ranges are often used as a measurement of space use, which provides a quantitative value of an animal's movement patterns in relation to various biological factors. A factor that is often overlooked in the analysis of movement patterns is the effect of moon phase, despite its known impact on the activity and hunting success of nocturnal predators. We live-trapped, radio-collared and monitored five black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) in the Golden Gate Highlands National Park, South Africa, between 2018 and 2019 to determine the impact of various environmental factors on movement patterns. Annual home ranges varied between individuals, were larger in subadults and overlapped between three jackals. Space use and travel velocity suggested a crepuscular activity pattern with a reliance on nocturnal activity and limited diurnal activity. Individual space use suggested variation between moon phases, although overall variation was negligible. Jackals travelled farther during new moon, compared with full moon, with the most notable difference between 23:00 and 04:00. Our results suggest that jackal behaviour does not align with the predation risk hypothesis. Space use and travel velocities varied between seasons, possibly because of differences in activity during mating and pupping periods. Our study confirms the flexibility in jackal space use and suggests a possible relationship with moon phase.

The CAP framework addresses inception; design and development of goals, measures, and strategies; and plan implementation and evaluation. The specific components of the CAP include defining the project scope and conservation targets; assessing the ecological viability; ascertaining threats and surrounding situation; identifying opportunities and designing strategies for action; and implementing actions and monitoring results. In 2007, TNC and a multidisciplinary graduate student team from the University of Michigan's School of Natural Resources and Environment initiated a CAP for the St. Marys River, the connecting channel between Lake Superior and Lake Huron, and its local watershed. The students not only gained experience in conservation planning, but also learned lessons that notably benefited the CAP process and were valuable for any successful collaborative effort a dedicated core team improved product quality, accelerated the timeline, and provided necessary support for ongoing efforts; an academic approach in preparation for engagement in the planning process brought applicable scientific research to the forefront, enhanced workshop facilitation, and improved stakeholder participation; and early and continuous. interactions with regional stakeholders improved cooperation and built a supportive network for collaboration.

These rapid developments come with an increasing need for analytical skills, which are hardly accessible to managers. On the other hand, researchers spend more and more time on research grant applications and administrative tasks, which leaves fewer opportunities for knowledge transfer. This situation tends to increase the gap between researchers and managers. Here, we illustrate how to fill this gap by presenting two long-term collaborations between a research unit-Centre for Functional and Evolutionary Ecology; CEFE-and a national agency-French Biodiversity Agency; OFB.The first example is a collaboration providing statistical support to national parks for the design and implementation of scientific monitoring protocols. It relies on the recruitment of a research engineer funded by OFB and physically based at CEFE, who works closely with OFB and managers. The second example is a collaboration on the management of large carnivores. For more than 10 years, it has involved several PhD students and post-doctoral fellows co-supervised by CEFE and OFB, and has recently resulted in the recruitment of a permanent OFB researcher who works half-time at CEFE and half-time at OFB. These case studies illustrate the modalities of collaborative work between public institutions acting at different levels of biodiversity conservation for the co-construction of research agendas and the exchange of knowledge.These collaborations also bring out some challenges. Inter-knowledge and mutual learning remain difficult at scales larger than that of the teams concerned. The staff working at this interface needs to possess good listening skills, respect all partners' needs and demonstrate flexibility. Knowledge exchanges require time, thus reducing productivity according to quantitative metrics such as scientific publications or institutional reports. These collaborations can therefore be difficult to assume socially, and remain tenuous because they rely on a good understanding of the differences in governance of the various partners.Based on our experience, success is favoured by long-term and close relationships, and by co-construction of projects at early stage.

However, culture is at least in part a human response to the ecological challenges that a society faces; hence, it should not be surprising that the degree to which societies regulate the level of individual freedom is related to environmental circumstances. Previous research suggests that levels of societal freedom across countries are systematically related to three types of ecological threats: prevalence of pathogens, climate challenges, and natural disaster threat. Though their incidence overlaps, the literature has not yet provided a competitive test. Drawing upon the ecocultural framework, we tested five rival hypotheses, alternately focused on the above ecological factors and their interactions with economic wealth in explaining country variations in socio-political freedom. Focusing on data from 150 countries, we performed a series of linear mixed-effects regressions predicting freedom in the domains of politics, media, and economy. We found that countries with higher pathogen prevalence were more likely to suppress democracy and media freedom. Economic wealth, however, moderated the effect of pathogen prevalence on economic freedom, with the main effect being only found among wealthy countries, but not among poor countries. In contrast, natural disaster threat predicted political freedom and press freedom only among poor countries, consistent with the idea that disaster threat accompanied by poor resources promote socio-political freedom as a means of increasing collective survival. Throughout our analyses, we found no support for hypotheses based on climatic challenges. In addition, our multilevel approach revealed that country scores for socio-political freedom were highly clustered within world regions, accounting for substantial portions of variance. Overall, the present research offers a nuanced view of the interplay between ecology and wealth in the emergence of socio-political freedom.

In today's knowledge society, the amount of scientific-applied information, which university graduates have to acquire, continues to increase continuously. There is a concurrent reduction in the number of study hours to undertake educational programmes in order to increase the hours for students' independent work. Against this background, higher school is required to increase future experts' competencies. Therefore, the content of fundamental and special disciplines of entire period of training and independent work of students should be thoroughly coordinated by increasing students' motivation to self-education and self-development. Classroom-based and independent learning of disciplines and sections of fundamental academic courses, especially chemistry, is impossible without formation of students' scientific thinking. Today, it is difficult to consider the activity of most professionals without the ability to think scientifically: active expansion of science into professional sphere has a strong tendency to be increased. The aim of the present research is to show the possibilities of formation and development of scientific thinking in the students of natural-scientific and technical directions of education using the example of studying of one of the elements of programmes in chemistry (the method of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis). Methodology and research methods. The research was carried out on the basis of competency-based, systematic and interdisciplinary approaches. The methods of analysis, synthesis, integration, differentiation and compactification of fundamental knowledge and training material were used. Results and scientific novelty. The high potential of chemical education for formation of scientific thinking, subject content (chemical), natural-scientific and holistic scientific thinking is emphasised. However, chemistry education in higher education institution is complicated by the absence of the unified structure of fundamental preparation, the preservation of extensive approach to the content of chemical disciplines, the irrational organisation of students' independent work, which now is accounted for a half of instructional time. Overcoming these problems lies in the dialectic unity of fundamental and practice-oriented knowledge, which is provided by the compliance with the principles of continuity and interdisciplinarity. It is necessary to provide deductive structurisation of training material in order to give integrity and systemacity to the content of education, without which it is impossible to create a comprehensive natural-scientific picture of the world in students. The key initial element of vocational training stimulating the formation of reflexive skills and scientific thinking of future experts is mastering by students of a categorical-conceptual framework of science, which is consistently and comprehensively revealed throughout a high school stage of education. The authors designated phases of development of scientific thinking (formal-logical, reflexive-theoretical, hypothetico-deductive thinking), which are not clearly differentiated due to interpenetration and entanglement of their components and identity of thought processes in terms of their speed and quality. However, the allocation of these stages allows to structure and to correct the content of educational material taking into account the characteristics and the level of students' readiness. From these standpoints, the expediency of more detailed examination of the NMR method is proved within the disciplines such as Chemistry, General Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry and Analytical Chemistry (a part of material about the NMR method can be worked out by students independently). This method, based on one phenomenon, includes hundreds of various types of the experiments, which are intended for receiving particular information. The NMR method is widely used both in scientific research, including master's thesis, and in the most various manufacturing spheres. Today, the spectroscopy of NMR is recognised as the most powerful informative and perspective method of structural analysis of substance. The fundamental nature, interdisciplinarity and universality of the method provide students with basic professional knowledge on physics, chemistry, medicine, biology, technology and ecology. The authors of the present research propose the option of configuration of educational information on NMR. According to the suggested version, the principle of work is the following: firstly, bachelors study the system of key concepts and terms, moving gradually from formal-logical to substantial generalisations; then, students learn to explain the phenomena scientifically and to make forecasts, and, as a result, they become the owners of hypothetico-deductive thinking. The acquired competencies are the key to professional literacy, which is improved in master's degree programme, when the previously compactified scientific knowledge in a contracted form is developed in the form suitable for an optimal solution of a particular research or practical aim. The similar scheme of vocational training makes it possible to overcome traditional orientation of high school programmes of the natural-science block (i.e. retention of permanently growing amount of factual material). Practical significance.

To characterize the current state of ecological forecasting education, we compiled existing resources for teaching and learning ecological forecasting at three curriculum levels: online resources; US university courses on ecological forecasting; and US university courses on topics related to ecological forecasting. We found persistent patterns (1) in what topics are taught to US undergraduate students at each of the curriculum levels; and (2) in the accessibility of resources, in terms of course availability at higher education institutions in the United States.

We assessed variation of ecological status classifications of stream diatom and macroinvertebrate communities within a boreal river system. We specifically examined whether results of ecological classifications are concordant across taxonomic groups and among main channel and headwater side tributaries of this river system. We further assessed whether ecological classifications are stable from year to year and whether classifications show predictable relationships to major stressor gradients. The estimated ecological condition varied considerably among and between reaches of main channel and tributaries for both examined taxonomic groups. Ecological classifications also differed between the two taxonomic groups and were generally lower and temporally more variable for diatoms. Ecological Quality Ratios (EQR) of the metrics were mainly related to pH representing a major disturbance gradient in our study, but in general, relationships to stressor gradients were weak. Our results suggest that ecological classifications could be weakly extrapolated among sites and, depending on the taxonomic group, also among different years in river systems disturbed by anthropogenic activities.

Comparative studies of the evolutionary origins of migration in birds are widespread, but are lacking in mammals. Mammalian species have greater variation in functional traits that may be relevant for migration. Interspecific variation in migration behaviour is often attributed to mode of locomotion (i.e. running, swimming, and flying) and body size, but traits associated with the evolutionary precursor hypothesis, including geographic distribution, habitat, and diet, could also be important predictors of migration in mammals. Furthermore, mammals vary in thermoregulatory strategies and include many heterothermic species, providing an alternative strategy to avoid seasonal resource depletion. We tested the evolutionary precursor hypothesis for the evolution of migration in mammals and tested predictions linking migration to locomotion, body size, geographic distribution, habitat, diet, and thermoregulation. We compiled a dataset of 722 species from 27 mammalian orders and conducted a series of analyses using phylogenetically informed models. Swimming and flying mammals were more likely to migrate than running mammals, and larger species were more likely to migrate than smaller ones. However, heterothermy was common among small running mammals that were unlikely to migrate. High-latitude swimming and flying mammals were more likely to migrate than high-latitude running mammals (where heterothermy was common), and most migratory running mammals were herbivorous. Running mammals and frugivorous bats with high thermoregulatory scope (greater capacity for heterothermy) were less likely to migrate, while insectivorous bats with high thermoregulatory scope were more likely to migrate.

In response to those potential environmental challenges, China has put forward Green BRI and enriched the new Silk Road with more environmental connotations, aiming to reduce the conflict between economic development and eco-environmental protection. Currently, there is a lack of systematic and holistic research on eco-environmental issues in BRI regions. In addition, feasible solutions to enhance BRI's contribution to the eco-environment remain insufficient. Having systematically reviewed the relevant literature on the eco-environment in BRI regions, we found that most regions along the BRI routes are in sensitive zones of climate and geological change, with fragile eco-environments and strong vulnerability to climate change, natural disasters and human activities. The main eco-environment status of the BRI regions is as follows: (1) The total water resources in BRI regions account for only 36% of the global total, with uneven distribution and complex spatial precipitation, posing higher pressure on water security. (2) Vegetation varies significantly from region to region. The vegetation in South Asia is the richest, with its mean annual NDVI exceeding 0.7. The NDVI in East Europe, Russia and South China are between 0.4 and 0.7, and that in Central Asia and West Asia are below 0.2. (3) The BRI regions are abundantly blessed with natural resources, with the total recoverable oil reserves, natural gas reserves and the total mining area reaching 66%, 65.5% and 42.31% of the world's total, respectively, but severe overexploitation and overconsumption of those resources degrade their eco-environment.

The uniaxial compressive test was performed on the cubic specimens with a side length of 150 mm. The three-dimensional (3D) mesoscopic model with the consideration of random shapes and sizes of aggregates was developed. The parameters considered were the aggregate-to-cementitious material ratio (A/C), the water-to-cementitious material ratio (W/C), the aggregate size, and the void content. The results indicate that the collapse of aggregate caused by the sliding failure of bonding points among aggregates is the main failure mode of ecological concrete under uniaxial compression. The void content and compressive strength of ecological concrete are associated with the A/C and W/C, and the A/C of 6 is suggested as the optimal value. The compressive stress-strain curve consists of three parts, in which the platform period represents the yield period that is relative to the compacting process. Besides, the peak stress and the peak strains in the axial- and lateral directions are related to the void content and aggregate size, and the lateral strain is obviously larger than the axial strain. Through the comparison of numerical and test results, the developed 3D mesoscale modelling approach together with the model parameters has been approved in investigating the compressive behaviors of ecological concrete.

Here, we integrate and apply two interdisciplinary approaches to problem-solving-social-ecological systems thinking and ecocriticism-to understand the role of human culture in recognizing, driving, and responding to cedar's changing geographic distribution. We interpret the spread of cedar as a process of culturally induced range infilling due to the ongoing social-ecological impacts of colonization, analyze poetic literary texts to clarify the concepts that have so far informed different cultural values related to cedar, and explore the usefulness of diverse interdisciplinary collaborations and knowledge for addressing social-ecological challenges like cedar spread in the midst of rapidly unfolding global change. Our examination suggests that it is not only possible, but preferable, to address cedar spread as both a scientific and a social problem. Great Plains landscapes are teetering between grassland and woodland, and contemporary human societies both influence and choose how to cope with transitions between these ecological states. We echo previous studies in suggesting that human cultural values about stability and disturbance, especially cultural concepts of fire, will be primary driving factors in determining future trajectories of change on the Great Plains. Although invasion-based descriptors of cedar spread may be useful in ecological research and management, language based on the value of restraint could provide a common vocabulary for effective cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary communication about the relationship between culture and cedar, as well as an ethical framework for cross-cultural communication, decision-making, and management.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Allen, Craig/J-4464-2012; Twidwell, Dirac/D-3334-2012","Uden, Daniel/0000-0003-3801-5489",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1708-3087",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2017,22,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"46","10.5751/ES-09357-220246","http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ES-09357-220246",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000404997600040","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Geddes appears to have been the first person in Britain to adopt the term landscape architect to denote a profession in the American sense as someone who dealt with city planning, civic design and parks systems. This profession seemed to encompass his wide ranging interests, providing a suitable vehicle for his transdisciplinary approaches, but which he later transferred to that of town and regional planning. His approach to understanding landscapes was to study towns and regions from a cultural, ecological and economic perspective in a systematic way of survey, analysis and design. Geddes's methods were gradually adopted by the landscape architecture profession, and purely Beaux Arts-architectural approaches phased out. By tracing contemporary references, this paper highlights key individuals who helped to promote his ideas in the landscape architecture profession then and now, and shows how his enduring influence and longstanding impact have to do with the systematic approach and methods he set forth. Today similar approaches are being promoted by other professions, but with a different perspective, and suggests that rather than various disciplines setting up silos, trying to defend their territories, with climate change and food security looming it is timely to promote more integrated approaches.

This article uses qualitative content, bibliometric, and citation network analyses to systematically review the scope, methods, and findings of 276 studies on adaptive capacity of social and social-ecological systems. The review demonstrates that adaptive capacity research is highly interdisciplinary; covers a wide range of sectors, geographic locations, and scales of analysis; and is highly fragmented.

However, there are serious debates concerning the degree and extent of this influence. We argue that delving into the long-term history of a system by compiling research from multiple disciplines helps ecologists to understand the key drivers of ecosystem structure and dynamics, including the role of humans. We use a case study of the endangered Garry oak ecosystem of southern British Columbia (Canada) to show how considering an extended timeline can reveal surprises that challenge conceptions of the way an ecosystem functions. In this system, ecological experiments have shown that the current dominance of exotic species is not due to competitive superiority, but a result of habitat fragmentation and changes in herbivory and disturbance regimes since European settlement. Historical and ethnographic research point to the purposeful and regular use of fire by the Coast Salish peoples of this region, and land survey records indicate that Garry oak has not always been the prime savannah tree species. Paleoecological studies document the maintenance of open savannah habitat in the late Holocene despite cooler, wetter climatic conditions that favour coniferous forests, suggesting a very long history of indigenous management. Archaeological evidence confirms the prolonged presence of human societies on the landscape. These insights contribute both to improved ecological theory and better restoration strategies, and show that ecosystems created via long-term human management are equally valid targets for conservation as ecosystems that have experienced less human influence.

This critical review takes an interdisciplinary approach to synthesize trends across case studies, evaluate design methodologies, and identify future opportunities when applying ecosystem biomimicry to engineering practices, including cyber systems (CS), physical systems (PS), and cyber-physical systems (CPS). After systematically sourcing publications from major databases, the papers were first analyzed at a meta level for their bibliographic context and for statistical correlations among categorical variables. Then, we investigated deeper into the engineering applications and design methodologies. Results indicate that CPS most frequently mimic organisms and ecosystems, while CS and PS frequently mimic populations-communities and molecules-tissues-organ systems, respectively (statistically highly significant). An indirect approach is most often used for mimicry at organizational levels from populations to ecosystems, while a direct approach frequently suits levels from molecules to organisms (highly significant). Dominant themes across engineering applications include symbiotic organism search algorithms for CS and ecological network analysis for CPS, while PS are highly diverse. For design methodologies, this work summarizes and details ten well-documented biomimetic process models among literature, which addresses an outdated concern for a lack of systematic methods for ecosystem biomimicry.

Despite the dramatic growth in the understanding of freshwater ecosystems in recent decades, many analyses indicate that the magnitude, complexity and urgency of freshwater environmental problems are increasing rather than decreasing. This pattern serves as a sobering reminder that ecological science is necessary but not sufficient for addressing a wide range of sustainability challenges and suggests the need for alternative strategies that can increase the effectiveness of science in environmental problem solving. 2. One key step in efforts to link knowledge with action more effectively is to use a conceptual model that examines factors leading to mismatches between the demand for science to achieve various societal goals and the supply of scientific information by researchers. Some common examples of supply and demand mismatches include instances where scientific information is provided but not needed, is needed but not provided, is not sufficiently trusted or reliable or conflicts with user's values or interests. 3. Recent work in sustainability science and related fields suggests that such mismatches can be reduced by more careful attention to the design of interdisciplinary research programmes and stakeholder partnerships. For example, research should be salient to the concerns of stakeholders. Research also needs to be independent and objective, so that it is credible to stakeholders. Moreover, researchers should work with stakeholders in ways that foster legitimate decision-making processes. We show how such design criteria can help in identifying and overcoming potential obstacles which limit the influence of ecological research on decision making. 4. These strategies are illustrated by a collaborative programme designed to promote the sustainable management of vernal pools in the northeastern U.S.A. These unique ecosystems are vulnerable to multiple stressors associated with urbanisation, forest management and climate change. An interdisciplinary team of researchers with a wide array of expertise (e.g., ecology, economics, communication, institutional governance, regional planning and forestry) has established a long-term partnership with multiple levels of government, the private sector, conservation organisations and citizens. Using a variety of approaches for linking knowledge with action, this programme has helped produce new land use regulations and management practices designed to balance economic development and vernal pool protection. 5. Thematic implications: freshwater ecosystems are increasingly impaired by multiple stressors that are usually the product of complex interactions between socioeconomic and biophysical factors. Thus, an understanding of the biophysical causes and consequences of such impairment will rarely be sufficient for achieving sustainable management policies and practices. Rather, we need a more integrative and action-oriented approach that explicitly acknowledges the strong coupling between natural and human systems and focuses on reciprocal interactions between knowledge-generating and decision-making processes. We believe that the emerging field of sustainability science holds considerable promise for strengthening connections between knowledge and action.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0046-5070","1365-2427",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2010,55,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,"258","269",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02370.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02370.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000273687100015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Method: A multiple-baseline single-case experimental design included four severely affected tinnitus volunteers who were recruited online and randomized into different phasing schedules. Baseline phase (A) ranged from 11 to 24 days, followed by an EMA phase (B) for the remainder of the 33-day schedule. End-of-day diary assessments of tinnitus experience (e.g., annoyance, intrusiveness, mood) were visually inspected, and complemented with inferential statistics (randomization tests and Tau-U). Results: End-of-day diary data revealed no change in broadened median between phases. Nevertheless, tinnitus experience scores improved as variability decreased and a significant improvement in stress was observed through weighted Tau-U statistics.

We compared climate-only, land use-only, and combination models of climate and land use, derived from two different model selection techniques, to determine which was most likely to drive current distributions of cold-adapted amphibian species. Land use layers included land cover type, human population, vegetation type, ecoregion, and the overall human footprint. The most supported models included both climate and land use, with climate and human footprint variables having the highest permutation importance and percent contribution. Models that incorporated climate and land use data performed best as measured with AIC and AUC, although qualitatively most underestimated the northern range edge, implying potential sampling bias or locations of reduced habitat quality for these species in the northern area of the ranges. There were small differences in overall combination models dependent on the method of model selection. The overall effect sizes of landscape factors within the combination models were small except for one landscape feature: human footprint, which incorporated multiple aspects of anthropogenic change on the landscape, including human population density, travel access, and agricultural impact. This aspect of the landscape was just as important as climate, and counter to what we expected, the association was mostly positive, with a negative response only occurring at very high levels.

Findings In this paper, the authors convey the manner in which outsiders (such as tourists) permanently influence the traditional craft culture of indigenous communities in a largely unexplored cultural ecological niche in Namibia by purchasing low cost, easily mass produced, yet inauthentic brightly colored objects. It is likely that craft processes designed for revenue generation will encroach on the role of the master crafters in Namibian society and permanently redirect creative activities away from the indigenous practices. Research limitations/implications The researchers acknowledge the biases they have, as outsiders, in their perception of Namibian master crafters and craft practices.

In this sense, forestry plantations can be viewed as simple forest ecosystems, allowing us to better isolate and understand the mechanisms that drive forest function, structure, and biodiversity. On Hawai'i Island, 68 forest stands representing 12 species of monotypic forestry plantations, in addition to stands of native forest and grass pastures, were surveyed at three sites to observe the effects of monotypic canopies on earthworm biomass and occurrence of rooting by feral pigs. The canopy species strongly influenced earthworm biomass at each site (r(2) = 0.98, 0.99, 0.92; p < 0.001). Earthworm biomass was strongly correlated to underlying soil age when examined by individual canopy species (r(2) = 0.96-0.98; p < 0.001). Earthworm biomass was highly correlated to the occurrence of rooting by feral pigs at each site (r(2) = 0.92, 0.94, 0.64; p < 0.001). Each site exhibited a different sensitivity of pig rooting in response to earthworms. Canopy and site data could thus be used to estimate total soil disturbance by feral pigs, and inform aspects of forest management regarding soil erosion, biodiversity habitat, and hunting or trapping of feral pigs.

Functional measures of connectivity typically seek to integrate aspects of landscape structure and animal movement to describe ecologically meaningful connectedness at the landscape and population scale. Despite this focus on function, traditional measures of landscape connectivity assume it is a static property of the landscape, hence abstracting out the underlying spatiotemporal population dynamics. Connectivity is, arguably, a dynamic property of landscapes, and is inherently related to the spatial distribution of individuals and populations across the landscape. Static representations of connectivity potentially overlook this variation and therefore adopting a dynamic approach should offer improved insights about connectivity and associated ecological processes. Using a large-scale, long-term time series of occupancy data from a metapopulation of water voles Arvicola amphibius, we tested competing hypotheses about how considering the dynamic nature of connectivity improves the ability of spatially explicit occupancy models to recover population dynamics. Iteratively relaxing standing assumptions of connectivity metrics, these models ranged from spatially and temporally fixed connectivity metrics that are widely applied, to the more flexible, but lesser used model that allowed temporally varying connectivity measures that incorporate spatiotemporally dynamic patch occupancy states. Our results provide empirical evidence that demographic weighting using patch occupancy dynamics and temporal variability in connectivity measures are important for describing metapopulation dynamics. We highlight the implications of commonly held assumption in connectivity modelling and demonstrate how they result in different and highly variable predictions of metapopulation capacity. Thus, we argue that the concept of connectivity and its potential applications would benefit from recognizing inherent spatiotemporal variation in connectivity that is explicitly linked to underlying ecological state variables.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sutherland, Chris/H-6624-2019; Lambin, Xavier/E-8284-2011","Lambin, Xavier/0000-0003-4643-2653; Drake, Joseph/0000-0003-0458-3533; Sutherland, Chris/0000-0003-2073-1751",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0021-8790","1365-2656",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2022,91,"10",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2050","2060",NA,"10.1111/1365-2656.13783","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13783",NA,"JUL 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35871483,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000832924200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Moreover, other key factors, particularly the supply of limiting macronutrients and disturbances, may supersede the importance of host identity. We tested the following four non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: (a) The Host Identity Hypothesis: endophytes vary substantially among different host-plant species. (b) The Core Microbiome Hypothesis: a subset of microbial taxa will be shared among all host-plant species. (c). The Soil Resource Supply Hypothesis: endophytes vary substantially among habitats with experimentally elevated levels of macronutrients. (d) The Disturbance-Disruption Hypothesis: disturbances created by the periodic application of antibiotics structure bacterial endophyte communities. We tested these hypotheses by characterizing endophytes using high-throughput sequencing among seedlings of five phylogenetically diverse tree species nested within a long-term, full factorial nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium soil fertilization experiment. We artificially disturbed one of our focal species by applying antibiotics every 10-14 days for 29 months within the soil (N, P, K) fertilization experiment. While we detected a significant effect of host identity and soil nutrient additions, together they explained little variation in endophyte community composition (<10%). We found unequivocal evidence for a core microbiome shared by all species. Specifically, we inferred that nine OTUs were present among 95% or more of all control saplings, representing a third of the total reads. These bacterial taxa belonged to the Actinobacteria. In contrast, disturbance (antibiotics) explained more endophyte variation than all nutrient addition combinations combined and twice the variation explained by host identity for all five tree species. Synthesis. Our results challenge the idea that host identity is a primary filter shaping bacterial endophyte communities; this suggests that many of the same bacterial taxa occur inside plant hosts even if those host plants are phylogenetically diverse. Moreover, we documented a distinct core microbiome shared among our five focal tree species.

Endpoint of the study was a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) score on ecological and climate crisis (0-20 points). Association between variables and KAP score was assessed by Kruskal-Wallis' or Spearman's test, as appropriate, and significant variables were included into ordinal regression model and reported as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results Both KAP and eco-anxiety scores showed acceptable levels of consistency with Cronbach's alpha. A total of 605 medical doctors and students living in 19 Italian regions were included in the study. Median age [Q1-Q3] was 27.6 [24.1-31.3] and females were 352 (58.2%). Despite showing good attitudes toward climate action, knowledge gap were found, with 42.5% (n = 257) of the respondents not knowing the temperature limits set by the Paris Agreements and 45.5% (n = 275) believing that climate change is caused by sunspots. Fears suggestive for eco-anxiety were common. At multivariable ordinal regression, high levels of eco-anxiety (aOR 1.29, p = 0.001) and low trust in government action (aOR 1.96, p = 0.003) were associated with a higher KAP score.

Humans began affecting the landscape of this high mountain region during the Bronze Age. Multiproxy palaeoenvironmental studies show that the present cultural landscape of the valley has been the result of long-term human environmental interactions. Pollen, soil and tree analyses were combined with archaeological and historical archives to provide strong evidence of the complexity of the high-mountain land-use system over the last 3500 years. Phases of agro-pastoral activity from Bronze Age (around 1300 BC), Iron Age (800-15 BC), Roman Period (15 BC-AD 450) and Middle Ages (AD 450-1500) are linked to climate and economic, social and cultural developments. Our results reveal that expansions of pasture land, in combination with climatic fluctuations, led to pronounced ecological changes in St Antonien Valley. Humans adjusted land-use practices according to changing environmental conditions. In this context, the use of fire was an important factor in land management.

We compare reduced vs. conventional fertilization, as well as mechanical vs. chemical weed control (with herbicides) in a long-term, full-factorial, multidisciplinary experiment. We conducted the experiment in an oil palm company estate in Sumatra, Indonesia, and report the results of the first 2 years. We measured soil nutrients and functions, surveyed above- and below-ground organisms, tracked oil palm condition and productivity, and calculated plantation gross margins. Plants, aboveground arthropods, and belowground animals were positively affected by mechanical vs. chemical weed control, but we could not detect effects on birds and bats. There were no detectable negative effects of reduced fertilization or mechanical weeding on oil palm yields, fine roots, or leaf area index. Also, we could not detect detrimental effects of the reduced fertilization and mechanical weeding on soil nutrients and functions (mineral nitrogen, bulk density, and litter decomposition), but water infiltration and base saturation tended to be higher under mechanical weeding, while soil moisture, and microbial biomass varied with treatment. Economic performance, measured as gross margins, was higher under reduced fertilization.

The rich transdisciplinary literature on borderlands has fruitfully deployed van Schendel's insights to re-spatialise areas and states but has devoted scant attention to such question. Drawing from 'new materialist' scholarship in IR and the concept of scale in political geography, the paper argues that fluid and fractionally coherent combinations of weapons as technical objects that come from somewhere, rationalities, and techniques of arms control reproduce multiple scales of territorial authority and struggles over scaled modes of governing violence in borderlands. Such struggles of scales and about scale constantly reconfigure the territorial arenas of authority on violence at the edge of the state. Based on fieldwork in Ta'ang areas of northern Shan State, Myanmar, the article develops an empirical analysis of encounters between explosive devices/landmines and the subjects and spaces they target. Delving into the processes and practices of `making' and controlling the landmine', 1 find that different socio-political orders confront themselves through rationalities, techniques, and practices of humanitarian arms control via which they navigate/jump across scales, forge new ones, or mobilise multi-scalar alliances.

However, plant intelligence is a disputed concept in the scientific community. Reasons for lack of consensus can be traced back to the history of Western philosophy, interpretation of terminology, and due to plants lacking neurons and a central nervous system. Plant intelligence thus constitutes a novel paradigm in the plant sciences. Therefore, the perspectives of scientists in plant-related disciplines need to be investigated in order to gain insight into the current state and future development of this concept. Methods This study analyzed opinions of plant intelligence held by scientists from different plant-related disciplines, including ethnobiology and other biological sciences, through an online questionnaire. Results Our findings show that respondents' personal belief systems and the frequency of taking into account other types of knowledge, such as traditional knowledge, in their own field(s) of study, were associated with their opinions of plant intelligence.

Consensus is possible only when there is agreement on the spatial entities to be mapped. We propose a way of defining such entities and identifying them in any given landscape. Landscapes are conceived in terms of a conceptual biophysical template that constrains a wide range of ecological processes at various hierarchical levels. The template is conceived as comprising co-evolved associations of soils, vegetation, topography and hydrology that form a dynamic mosaic characteristic of a particular topographic, climatic and geological context that is continually being shaped by many perturbations. We synthesise themes from vegetation, soil and river sciences, using hierarchy theory to frame a perspective that facilitates the definition of mappable landscape entities at three hierarchical levels of organisation.

This study compared canopy heights derived from NAIP DSMs (10 m) and point clouds to those derived from lidar data collected over Mountain Lake Biological Station and the Great Smoky Mountains Twin Creeks Site by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform for 62 mixed deciduous tree plots. Mean dominant height (MDH) was estimated using lidar and the NAIP products using the 90th percentile of heights in a given plot as the independent variable for both the lidar-and NAIP-derived point clouds. The dependent variable was field-measured MDH, calculated using the four tallest trees for each 0.04-hectare plot based on the NEON woody vegetation structure dataset. All data (field and remotely sensed) were collected in 2018. Using maximum likelihood spatial error model for all analyses, the NAIP DSM (10 m resolution) resulted in a strong relationship with MDH (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.90, standard error (SE) = 1.71 m). However, the 90th percentiles of heights derived from the point clouds were better at estimating MDH than was the comparatively coarse resolution DSM (NAIP point clouds: R-2 = 0.94, SE = 1.40 m; lidar: R-2 = 0.95, SE= 1.29 m, respectively) and are strongly correlated to each other (R-2 = 0.99, SE = 0.68 m). The main limitation of the NAIP datasets was found to be where shadowing occurred due to steep terrain in the Great Smoky Mountain site. These areas resulted in erroneously high vegetation heights. Mean dominant heights estimated using NAIP DSMs and point clouds are thus comparable to those estimated using lidar data in these closed-canopy temperate deciduous forests where shadowing from steep terrain is not present. The utility of both the NAIP-derived 10 m DSM and the point clouds for estimating tree heights paves the way for statewide mapping of heights over the deciduous forests in Tennessee, Virginia, and possibly beyond.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Prior, Elizabeth/0000-0001-7069-160X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1569-8432","1872-826X",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2022,110,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"102813","10.1016/j.jag.2022.102813","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.102813",NA,"MAY 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000806515800002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Ecosystem-based management is the most predominant approach found in the literature as a means to address land-sea interactions. Papers referring to ecosystem-based management are more likely than those referring to alternative management approaches (e.g., integrated management) to highlight science-policy integration and the need to account for interactions between ecosystem components as elements of effective governance.

A comprehensive dataset sourced from over 230 bibliographic references and public databases, comprising over 30,000 reports of Medusozoa in the Iberian region, reveals 593 species across the four medusozoan classes (549 hydrozoans, 37 scyphozoans, 5 staurozoans, and 2 cubozoans). Additionally, publicly available genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic metadata from the phylum Cnidaria are incorporated. The analyses highlight Hydrozoa as the most frequently reported and diverse class in the Iberian region. Specifically, the order Leptothecata exhibits the highest diversity, while Siphonophorae stands out as the most documented with Physalia physalis emerging as the highest reported species. Spatial distribution patterns reveal that holoplanktonic species are more widespread and abundant than their benthic and meroplanktonic counterparts. Furthermore, medusozoans with a free-swimming life form display greater diversity and dispersal compared to sessile species. The Northeast Atlantic section of the region demonstrates greater medusozoan diversity compared to the Mediterranean.

The natural properties of river systems have been drastically altered and reshaped, limiting the use of management frameworks, their scientific knowledge base and their ability to provide adequate solutions for current problems and those of the future, such as climate change, biodiversity crisis and increased demands for water resources. To address these challenges, a socioecologically driven research agenda for river systems that complements current approaches is needed and proposed. The implementation of the concepts of social metabolism and the colonisation of natural systems into existing concepts can provide a new basis to analyse the coevolutionary coupling of social systems with ecological and hydrological (i.e.,'socio-ecohydrological') systems within rivers. To operationalize this research agenda, we highlight four initial core topics defined as research clusters (RCs) to address specific system properties in an integrative manner. The colonisation of natural systems by social systems is seen as a significant driver of the transformation processes in river systems. These transformation processes are influenced by connectivity (RC 1), which primarily addresses biophysical aspects and governance (RC 2), which focuses on the changes in social systems. The metabolism (RC 3) and vulnerability (RC 4) of the social and natural systems are significant aspects of the coupling of social systems and ecohydrological systems with investments, energy, resources, services and associated risks and impacts. This socio-ecohydrological research agenda complements other recent approaches, such as 'socio-ecological', 'socio-hydrological' or 'socio-geomorphological' systems, by focusing on the coupling of social systems with natural systems in rivers and thus, by viewing the socioeconomic features of river systems as being just as important as their natural characteristics.

Here, we used molecular data to investigate patterns of persistence and dispersal in an ecologically and economically important carpenter bee (Xylocopa grisescens Lepeletier) found throughout the semiarid Caatinga region of Brazil. We used a genome-wide approach (double digest restriction-site associated DNA, ddRAD) to gather genetic data from bees sampled from eight sites within a semiarid region subject to desertification in Northeastern Brazil. Across all populations, we observed a consistent heterozygosity and effective population size deficit along with low genetic differentiation. We did not find strong evidence of dispersal limitations caused by desertification in this study system despite data collection from sites up to 300 km distant. Thus, our data suggest that human-mediated changes in the Caatinga, such as habitat loss, have impacted the population genetic patterns of X. grisescens. However, these impacts have also been softened by the species' biological characteristics, such as its relatively high capacity for movement. This study provides insights into how habitat changes might impact the long-term survival of large solitary bees. This study examines the genetic status of native carpenter bees in a Brazilian region vulnerable to desertification. Employing a population genomic approach, we found low genetic diversity with high homogeneity across populations, even over distances exceeding 300 km. The findings suggest that these bees may counteract desertification and habitat degradation through their mobility, facilitating gene flow and maintaining a continuous population distribution.image",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Faria, Christiana/AGU-9712-2022; Zanette, Lorenzo/E-6196-2017; Brasil, Sandara/JJF-1342-2023; Brasil, Sandara Nadja Rodrigues/JJF-1874-2023","Brasil, Sandara Nadja Rodrigues/0000-0001-5141-608X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-7758",NA,NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2024,14,"8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"e70085","10.1002/ece3.70085","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.70085",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,39165545,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001293235700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To exploit locations or explore the landscape? This is the competition-colonization trade-off, a dichotomy at the core of ecological succession. In bacterial communities, this trade-off is a fundamental mechanism towards understanding spatio-temporal fluxes in microbiome composition. Results Using microfluidics devices as structured bacterial habitats, we show that, in a synthetic two-species community of motile strains, Escherichia coli is a fugitive species, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a slower colonizer but superior competitor. We provide evidence highlighting the role of succession and the relevance of this trade-off in the community assembly of bacteria in spatially distributed patchy landscapes.

These lakes are mostly located in arid and semi-arid regions located in endorheic basins, which combined with the low precipitation and high evaporation rates typical for these regions, may lead to the accumulation of pollutants. Saline lakes are polluted mainly through inputs of agricultural wastewater along with organic and inorganic wastes from domestic and industrial sources. The excessive anthropogenic loading of nutrients, especially nitrogen (N), can result in eutrophication of these ecosystems. Here, the importance of pollution in saline lakes was assessed, placing special emphasis on N pollution and its attenuation in aquatic interfaces. Two main interfaces are present in saline lakes: (1) the sediment-water interface; (2) the freshwater-saltwater interface. While the former is the most important one for microbial turnover, the latter plays also a key role in pollution attenuation based on solute transport by density-driven flows. The study of how saline lakes can attenuate N pollutants (e.g. nitrate) is a step forward in preserving the good ecological status of these ecosystems.

For the water column, different sampling approaches are compared such as in situ collection using a Niskin bottle and online pumping. By monitoring several physicochemical parameters of the water column, we identify the ecological niche where MTB live.

Animal movement behavior has the potential to mediate the extent and intensity of active subsidies and corresponding ecosystem responses. Animal movement behaviors could interact with mortality risk to affect active subsidy distributions and ecosystem impacts but have rarely been examined in existing ecosystem models of spatial subsidies. Movement ecologists typically simulate animal dispersal and foraging movements using stochastic random walk models such as correlated random walk (CRW) and Levy walk (LW) models. Movement models generally implement mortality as an instantaneous mortality rate (i.e., probability of death per step). Variation in CRW and LW movement patterns, in combination with mortality rate level and model, can likely change emergent subsidy distributions and impact. Using a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM), we quantify how variation in the straightness (i.e., CRW) and step length (i.e., LW) of animal movement patterns with variation in mortality rate and model (i.e., distance-dependent versus time-dependent function) alter the intensity and extent of consumer and nutrient subsidy distributions. Movement pattern was a dominant determinant of subsidy displacement with more pronounced effects on consumer (i.e., living) subsidy (e.g., predators) patterns. Mortality rate and mortality model (i.e., distance-dependent versus time-dependent on LW) strongly predicted subsidy density with stronger effects on nutrient (i.e., dead) subsidy (e.g., feces) patterns. Consumer subsidies were deposited farther and at lower densities than nutrient subsidies. Given lower mortality rate, movements with more variable step lengths displaced both nutrient and consumer subsidies farther and at lower densities than straighter movements. Movements with more variable step lengths also resulted in greater nutrient subsidy numbers at lower densities with higher mortality rate in distance-dependent compared to time-dependent mortality models. We conclude that ecosystem modeling frameworks that incorporate interaction between animal movement behavior and mortality conditions will enhance insights into active subsidy distributions.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zollner, Patrick/A-8727-2010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0304-3800","1872-7026",NA,NA,NA,"NOV 15",2019,412,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"108824","10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108824","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108824",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000494885900005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Therefore, it is necessary to understand the combined effects of hydrological fluctuations and toxicants on aquatic biological communities. We investigated the individual and combined effects of the insecticide esfenvalerate and recurring fluctuations in water level on zooplankton communities in a system of 55 outdoor pond microcosms. The communities were exposed to esfenvalerate contamination as a single pulse (at 0.03, 0.3, or 3 mu g/L) and gradual removal of water and its subsequent replacement over three cycles and monitored until 84 days after contamination. The results showed that the sensitivities of the community and its constituent populations to the toxicant were increased by the hydrological stress. Specifically, for both the community structure and abundance of Daphnia spp. the lowest-observed-effect concentrations (LOEC) were 0.03 and 03 mu g/L for the series with fluctuating and constant water levels, respectively. Despite these differences in sensitivity, the interactive effects of the two stressors were found to be additive for both the community structure and the abundance of the most affected species. Presumably, it was not possible to detect synergism due to the strong individual effects of the water level fluctuations. Recovery times in the series exposed to the highest pesticide concentration were 64 and 55 days under fluctuating and constant water level regimes, respectively. Competition and water quality are suggested to be the major factors that underlie the observed effects of fluctuations in the water level. For the ecological risk assessment of toxicants, the present results suggest that (i) community sensitivity may vary substantially, depending on the environmental context, and (ii) this variability can be assessed experimentally to derive safety factors (coefficients used to avoid unexpected effects and define safe concentrations of toxicants) based on empirical findings.

The integration of the stakeholder driven approach with the science-based solution revealed that an integrated approach could be used as a tool to achieve conservation targets while simultaneously accounting for stakeholder's preferences, as the resulting integrated MPA solution met all conservation targets and was only slightly larger than the science-based solution alone. Results also revealed the potential utility of using stakeholders' knowledge as a proxy for identifying ecologically important areas when spatial data on conservation features are sparse.

We develop an ecological production framework that translates measurable indicators of stream water quality into ecological endpoints. Our interdisciplinary approach integrates a predictive hierarchical water quality model that is well suited for sparse data environments, an expert elicitation that translates measurable water quality indicators into ecological endpoints that focus group participants identified as most relevant, and a stated preference survey that elicits the public's willingness to pay for changes in these endpoints. To illustrate our methods, we develop an application to the Upper Neuse River Watershed located in the rapidly developing Triangle region of North Carolina (the United States). Our results suggest, for example, that residents are willing to pay roughly $127 per household and $54 million per year in aggregate (2021 US$) for water quality improvements resulting from a stylized intervention that increases stream bank canopy cover by 25% and decreases runoff from impervious surfaces, leading to improvements in water quality and ecological endpoints for local streams.

These functions are controlled by the sediment permeability that in turn is affected by biological and physical clogging. A number of conceptual models have been developed on the interactions and feedbacks between these functionalities; surprisingly, comprehensive field data are scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess these functions and their vulnerability along a stressor gradient of nutrient and fine-sediment input at riffle scale. Three sampling sites along the Kharaa River (Northern Mongolia) were selected that represented conditions from being unaffected, affected by biological clogging and impaired by physical clogging. A significant impact on the hydrological connectivity was detected, as the vertical downward flux and the solute penetration depth decreased along the reaches. Simultaneously, the heterogeneity in biogeochemical patterns and the vertical extent of the oxygen gradients declined. Whilst biological clogging was apparently unstable and the biofilm supported the hyporheic organic carbon pool, it revealed to affect the two functions to a lesser extent when compared with physical clogging. In contrast, physical clogging seemed to be more permanent and restricted microbial metabolism to the uppermost centimetres, thus decreasing the active sediment depth. Moreover, fine-sediment particles enhanced the sediment surface area, thereby creating a high respiration potential that resulted in high values of community respiration and subsequent oxygen depletion. Concluding, the control of fine-sediment emissions has to be a priority issue in river restoration and catchment management.

The growing interest in landscape stewardship has led to a focus on multistakeholder collaboration. Although there is a significant body of literature on collaborative management and governance of natural resources, the particular challenges posed by multifunctional landscapes, in which there are often contested interests, require closer attention. We present a case study from South Africa to investigate how collaborative stewardship can be fostered in contested multifunctional landscapes. We conducted this research through an engaged transdisciplinary research partnership in which we integrated social-ecological practitioner and academic knowledge to gain an in-depth understanding of the challenges of fostering collaboration. We identified five overarching factors that influence collaboration: contextual, institutional, social-relational, individual, and political-historical. Collaborative stewardship approaches focused on the development of formal governance institutions appear to be most successful if enabling individual and social-relational conditions are in place. Our case study, characterized by high social diversity, inequity, and contestation, suggests that consensus-driven approaches to collaboration are unlikely to result in equitable and sustainable landscape stewardship in such contexts. We therefore suggest an approach that focuses on enhancing individual and social-relational enablers. Moreover, we propose a bottom-up patchwork approach to collaborative stewardship premised on the notion of pluralism. This would focus on building new interpersonal relationships and collaborative capacity through small collective actions. Taking a relational, pluralistic approach to fostering collaborative stewardship is particularly important in contested, socially heterogeneous landscapes. Drawing on our study and the literature, we propose guiding principles for implementing relational, pluralistic approaches to collaborative stewardship and suggest future research directions for supporting such approaches.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rouget, Mathieu/B-7249-2008","Rouget, Mathieu/0000-0002-6172-3152; Shackleton, Sheona/0000-0002-6133-9070",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1708-3087",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2019,24,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"32","10.5751/ES-11085-240432","http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ES-11085-240432",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000506574000007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Design: Study one included data from 47 parents of preschool aged (3-5 years) children who completed the survey on two occasions. Study two included data from 943 participants who completed the survey as part of the larger Healthy Active Preschool Years Study. Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature and a series of focus groups were used to identify potential correlates for inclusion in the survey. Study one investigated the test-retest reliability of the survey; study two investigated internal reliability. Test-retest reliability was assessed using Kappa statistics and percent agreement for categorical variables, and intraclass correlation for continuous variables. Internal reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Results: In total, 230 items, summed and composite scores were assessed. Of those items, 190 (83%) showed acceptable reliability. The majority of items in each domain of the social ecological model - individual (75%), social (81%) and physical environment (90%) - showed acceptable reliability.

Here, we compare three different methods for parameter estimation - the common maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and two modified types of MLE correcting for binning of observations or random measurement errors. We test whether three typical frequency distributions, namely the power-law, negative exponential and Weibull distribution can be precisely identified, and how parameter estimates are biased when observations are additionally either binned or contain measurement error. We show that uncorrected MLE already loses the ability to discern functional form and parameters at relatively small levels of uncertainties. The modified MLE methods that consider such uncertainties (either binning or measurement error) are comparatively much more robust.

Therefore, differences in speed walking-related variables may have an effect, not only on the mobility of the group, but also on its composition. Some anthropometric parameters related to body length could affect walking speed-related variables and contribute to different human behaviors. However, there is currently little information on the influence of these parameters in nonadult individuals. Methods: Overall, 11 females and 17 male child/adolescents, 8-17 years of age, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. Five different pace walking tests were performed on a treadmill to calculate the optimal locomotion speed (OLS) and U-shaped relationship between the walking energy expenditure and speed (chi(2) cost of transport [CoT]) (i.e., energetic walking flexibility). Results: The mean OLS was 3.05 +/- 0.13 miles per hour (mph), with no differences between sexes. Similarly, there were no sex differences in walking flexibility according to the chi(2) CoT. Body height (p < .0001) and femur length (p < .001) were positively correlated with chi(2) CoT; however, female child/adolescents mitigated the effect of height and femur length when walking at suboptimal speeds. Conclusion: Consistent with prior observations in adults, our findings suggest that anthropometric parameters related to body stature are associated with reduced suboptimal walking flexibility in children and adolescents. Taken together, these results suggest that children and adolescents can adapt their pace to the one of taller individuals without a highly energetic penalty, but this flexibility decreases with increasing body size.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zorrilla Revilla, Guillermo/GQB-3970-2022; Volpe, Stella/ADJ-3489-2022; Prado-Nóvoa, Olalla/AEP-5901-2022; Robles, Rebeca/GOV-6128-2022","Howard, Kristen/0000-0003-1241-9565; Volpe, Stella/0000-0002-8593-320X; Prado Novoa, Olalla/0000-0002-5451-3819; Laskaridou, Eleni/0000-0003-2862-6673; Zorrilla-Revilla, Guillermo/0000-0003-0162-1848; GARCIA-GONZALEZ, REBECA/0000-0002-1035-6655",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1042-0533","1520-6300",NA,NA,NA,"2024 JUL 17",2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1002/ajhb.24138","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.24138",NA,"JUL 2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,39016420,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001270107000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

After visiting the nest for 19 days, we did not have any evidence of predation, and because of the size and behavior of the chicks during the last two visits, we assume that the nest was successful. Previous studies have suggested that urban systems lay open to colonization by species that can reach them, use their resources, and survive their hazards. We recorded a nest of Azure-crowned Hummingbirds that was built on an open sky telephone. Our observation was a notable example of the degree of venture that some individual birds can exhibit in response to urbanization, suggesting a certain degree of ecological plasticity.

We provide practical guidance on overcoming these barriers to mainstream the social sciences in conservation science, practice, and policy. Broadly, we recommend fostering knowledge on the scope and contributions of the social sciences to conservation, including social scientists from the inception of interdisciplinary research projects, incorporating social science research and insights during all stages of conservation planning and implementation, building social science capacity at all scales in conservation organizations and agencies, and promoting engagement with the social sciences in and through global conservation policy-influencing organizations. Conservation social scientists, too, need to be willing to engage with natural science knowledge and to communicate insights and recommendations clearly. We urge the conservation community to move beyond superficial engagement with the conservation social sciences. A more inclusive and integrative conservation scienceone that includes the natural and social scienceswill enable more ecologically effective and socially just conservation.

This study used SimaPro software to conduct life cycle assessments for each sidewalk pavement material type and applied the IMPACT 2002+ method. It also focused on the manufacturing and installation phases. The materials chosen for comparison were mosaic tile, interlocking concrete tile and stamped concrete. The results of the LCA for each pavement type indicated that the interlocking concrete tile has the minimum diverse impact on the environment.

Yet, despite this reality, it is often assumed that routine replenishment of populations of marine organisms on CRI is supported by locally-sourced propagules (hereafter, larvae). Following large disturbances, however, distantly-sourced larvae from less disturbed CRI within a regional meta-population are likely to be important for local population recovery, but evaluating the roles of locally-vs. distantly-sourced larvae remains difficult. While larval sources are relatively well-known for some fishes, they remain virtually unknown for most taxa, particularly those associated with the benthos, as exemplified by scleractinian corals. This review focuses on reef recovery and larval connectivity. Using corals as examples, we argue that CRI can serve as natural laboratories in which studies of these issues can enhance understanding of coral reef community dynamics under future disturbance regimes. Rather than focusing on synthesizing empirical data, we focus on the capacity for CRI to realize their potential in this research area, concluding that progress is impeded by the limited breadth, detail, and spatio-temporal concordance of existing research. Using long-term observational programs of coral reefs in Mo'orea (French Polynesia), Okinawa (Japan), and St. John (US Virgin Islands) as examples of the data currently available, we make the case that new modes of multidisciplinary and collaborative research will be required to exploit the value of CRI in understanding the role of connectivity in mediating ecosystem resilience in a future affected by anthropogenic disturbances.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Toonen, Rob/V-6230-2019; Suzuki, Go/E-5081-2011; Ang, Put/AAO-5490-2021; Adjeroud, Mehdi/J-6411-2016; Mitarai, Satoshi/G-8560-2015; Fujimura, Atsushi/ABH-5019-2020; Wyatt, Alex/A-9402-2008; Nakajima, Yuichi/A-4330-2013","Hench, James/0000-0002-7333-8913; Wyatt, Alex/0000-0002-1339-9546; Sutthacheep, Makamas/0000-0001-6648-4608; Paris-Limouzy, Claire Beatrix/0000-0002-0637-1334; Edmunds, Peter/0000-0002-9039-9347; Fujimura, Atsushi/0000-0002-5926-9579; Sakai, Kazuhiko/0000-0003-1905-5952; Nakajima, Yuichi/0000-0001-6558-5378",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2296-7745",NA,NA,NA,"AUG 27",2018,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"290","10.3389/fmars.2018.00290","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2018.00290",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000457369400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Grasping an item requires the coordinated action of several muscles and, consequently, the muscular anatomy can be expected to be a good indicator of grasping ability. Here, we quantitatively analyse the myology of the forelimb in Carnivora in relation to their grasping ability, arboreality and locomotor specializations. Carnivorans are a monophyletic group and a good model due to the fact that they vary in ecology and prehensile capabilities. We find that non-prehensile taxa differ in their muscle properties from poorly prehensile taxa and from intermediately to strongly prehensile taxa when taking into account variation in body size and phylogeny. Species with strong prehensile capabilities are characterized by a high force-producing capacity in the forelimb rotators. A strong grasp is not only advantageous for prehension, but also for climbing.

Through phylogeographic and phylogenetic analyses, two divergent lineages were identified located at the latitudinal extremes. The lineage located northern lineage (NG) of the Atacama Desert showed more genetic diversity and better-resolved phylogeographic structure than the southern lineage (SG). Considerable morphological variation across the geographical range corresponds with these genetic groups. We observed contrasting relationships between floral and vegetative traits: populations from the most arid region NG possessed larger flowers, but smaller vegetative values, and vice versa. Niche modelling and multivariate analyses, including environmental data, revealed different environmental requirements for each lineage. NG plants occur in regions with warmer and drier climatic conditions and at higher altitudes, while SG populations inhabit colder and more humid environments and lower altitudes. The evolutionary history of M. chilensis exhibits a phylogeographical footprint consistent with past fragmentation and allopatric differentiation, where the hyper-arid zone formed by the Atacama Desert clearly acted as an important gene flow barrier.

The Course introduces methodology of Backcasting scenarios in real sustainability problems. The learning environment is international, transdisciplinar, intergenarational and intercultural. It includes stakeholders' dialogues and discussions. The course is organized around current sustainability-relevant topics, which are analyzed in case studies based in different contexts: going from developed to developing countries and from local to global cases. Students apply scenario methodologies to the case studies in order to set up the most contextualized sustainable strategies. In 2012, UPC Barcelona Tech is running the course for the fifth time. This year it is organized within the Erasmus Intensive Program framework financed by EU. Students and lecturers from 6 European universities and with different backgrounds are participating in the course. The course is divided into 4 phases: 1- Local situation analysis. From March to May students analyze the topic in their own countries/regions. 2- Case study analysis. In May, students are grouped into international, multidisciplinary teams and define the current state of the case studies, as well as the questions and challenges that they pose. 3- Seminar at UPC. In June, students, lecturers and stakeholders meet in Barcelona, where the course is run for two weeks in a presential framework. 4- Evaluation of the course. Students analyze their learning experience in terms of competences acquisition. So far more than 130 students, 30 lecturers and 50 stakeholders have participated in the course. The topics analyzed in the course vary each year and are related to relevant sustainability challenges: urban solid waste management; food & drinks packaging waste; overfishing and marine ecosystem degradation; sustainable mobility and agro-ecology.

The goal of the present study was to holistically track antibiotic resistance and associated microbiomes at three distinct pre-harvest control points in an agroecosystem in order to identify the potential impacts of key agricultural management strategies. Samples were collected over the course of a single growing season (67 days) from field-scale plots amended with various organic and inorganic amendments at agronomic rates. Dairy-derived manure and compost amendment samples (n = 14), soil samples (n = 27), and lettuce samples (n = 12) were analyzed via shotgun metagenomics to assess multiple pre-harvest factors as hypothetical control points that shape lettuce resistomes. Pre-harvest factors of interest included manure collection during/post antibiotic use, manure composting, and soil amended with organic (stockpiled manure/compost) versus chemical fertilizer. Microbial community resistome and taxonomic compositions were unique from amendment to soil to lettuce surface according to dissimilarity analysis. The highest resistome alpha diversity (i.e., unique ARGs, n = 642) was detected in amendment samples prior to soil application, while the composted manure had the lowest total ARG relative abundance (i.e., 16S rRNA gene-normalized). Regardless of amendment type, soils acted as an apparent ecological buffer, i.e., soil resistome and taxonomic profiles returned to background conditions 67 d-post amendment application. Effects of amendment conditions surprisingly re-emerged in lettuce phyllosphere resistomes, with the highest total ARG relative abundances recovered on the surface of lettuce plants grown in organically-fertilized soils (i.e., compost- and manure-amended soils). Co-occurrence analysis identified 55 unique ARGs found both in the soil amendments and on lettuce surfaces. Among these, arnA and pmrF were the most abundant ARGs co-occurring with mobile genetic elements (MGE). Other prominent ARG-MGE co-occurrences throughout this pre-harvest lettuce production chain included: TetM to transposon (Clostridiodies difficile) in the manure amendment and TriC to plasmid (Ralstonia solanacearum) on the lettuce surfaces. This suggests that, even with imposing manure management and post-amendment wait periods in agricultural systems, ARGs originating from manure can still be found on crop surfaces. This study demonstrates a comprehensive approach to identifying key control points for the propagation of ARGs in vegetable production systems, identifying potential ARG-MGE combinations that could inform future surveillance. The findings suggest that additional pre-harvest and potentially post-harvest interventions may be warranted to minimize risk of propagating antibiotic resistance in the food chain.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wind, Lauren/L-8199-2019; Keenum, Ishi/AAP-5554-2021; Gupta, Suraj/AHA-3212-2022","Hession, William/0000-0002-6323-3827",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-302X",NA,NA,NA,"JUL 9",2021,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"683410","10.3389/fmicb.2021.683410","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.683410",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34305845,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000675869500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We used the visible-to-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) spectrometer of the Carnegie Airborne Observatory to develop maps of four plant chemical traits-leaf nitrogen per mass, leaf carbon per mass, leaf water concentration, and canopy water content-across a diverse Mediterranean-type ecosystem (Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, CA). For all four traits, plant community alone was the strongest predictor of trait variation (explaining 46-61% of the heterogeneity), whereas environmental gradients accounted for just one fourth of the variation in the traits. This result emphasizes the critical role that species composition plays in mediating nutrient and carbon cycling within and among different communities.

The World Health Organization reported these estimates and recognized the scarcity of large-scale, community-based, epidemiological data. In this context, we developed the Snake-Byte project that aims at (i) quantifying and mapping the impact of snakebite on human and animal health, and on livelihoods, (ii) developing predictive models for medical, ecological and economic indicators, and (iii) analyzing geographic accessibility to healthcare. This paper exclusively describes the methodology we developed to collect large-scale primary data on snakebite in humans and animals in two hyper-endemic countries, Cameroon and Nepal. Methodology/Principal findings We compared available methods on snakebite epidemiology and on multi-cluster survey development. Then, in line with those findings, we developed an original study methodology based on a multi-cluster random survey, enhanced by geospatial, One Health, and health economics components. Using a minimum hypothesized snakebite national incidence of 100/100,000/year and optimizing design effect, confidence level, and non-response margin, we calculated a sample of 61,000 people per country. This represented 11,700 households in Cameroon and 13,800 in Nepal. The random selection with probability proportional to size generated 250 clusters from all Cameroonian regions and all Nepalese Terai districts. Our household selection methodology combined spatial randomization and selection via high-resolution satellite images. After ethical approval in Switerland (CCER), Nepal (BPKIHS), and Cameroon (CNERSH), and informed written consent, our e-questionnaires included geolocated baseline demographic and socio-economic characteristics, snakebite clinical features and outcomes, healthcare expenditure, animal ownership, animal outcomes, snake identification, and service accessibility. Conclusions/Significance This novel transdisciplinary survey methodology was subsequently used to collect countrywide snakebite envenoming data in Nepal and Cameroon. District-level incidence data should help health authorities to channel antivenom and healthcare allocation. This methodology, or parts thereof, could be easily adapted to other countries and to other Neglected Tropical Diseases. Author summary Snakebite envenoming was recently classified as a priority neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization. Up to five million people are bitten, more than a million envenomed, and around 100,000 victims die, mainly in rural and remote areas of low- and middle-income countries. Snakebite envenoming not only affects victims acutely, but it can also cause long-term disability, disfiguring scars, and heavy economic burden due to treatment costs and inability to work. Previous studies have analyzed snakebite clinical, epidemiological, or socio-economic impacts independently, and little has been done to assess the impact of snakebite in animals and on the livelihoods of the communities that depend upon them. We present an innovative, holistic, national-scale methodology that includes epidemiology, One Health, economic, and geographic information science approaches into one multi-cluster household survey. We randomly selected 250 sub-district areas from all Cameroonian regions and all Nepali Terai districts, which represented more than 61,000 participants in each country.

For example, the concept of biocultural diversity, which highlights the interactions between human diversity and the diversity of biological systems, bridges multiple knowledge systems and disciplines and can reveal historical, existing, and emergent patterns of variation that are essential to ecosystem dynamics. Identifying biocultural diversity requires a flexible, creative, and collaborative approach to research. We demonstrate how visual art can be used in combination with scientific and social science methods to examine the biocultural landscape of the Sahtu region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. Specifically, we focus on the intersection of Dene cultural diversity and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) intraspecific variation. We developed original illustrations, diagrams, and other visual aids to increase the effectiveness of communication, improve the organization of research results, and promote intellectual creativity. For example, we used scientific visualization and drawings to explain complex genetic data and clarify research priorities. Visual facilitation during meetings helped establish accurate representations of both cultural and biological diversity by externalizing heterogeneity and avoiding standardization. Group mind mapping enhanced collaborators' ability to visualize connections between Dene concepts, like bets'erihcha respect and caribou, and to recognize differences between knowledge systems that challenge translations and reduce the effectiveness of research outcomes. Collaborative visual products, like posters that represented different caribou types, allowed Dene partners to more clearly articulate subtleties within caribou intraspecific variation that are manifest through distinct dialects, place-based relationships, and cultural practices.

Integrating multidisciplinary tasks, using qualitative methodologies, it is possible to develop an integral teaching and learning framework, aligning lab experiments and communication tasks, and addressing interpersonal team issues. Besides the experimental work, students must improve their communication skills by writing assignments. The ability to communicate clearly and concisely, both orally and in writing is an important skill that all engineers need to obtain to become truly successful in their professional career [1]. Poor verbal, written or visual communication will lead to confusion and the desired responses will be unsatisfying. This paper analyzes the results obtained in a survey conducted in engineering classrooms, where students were aimed at analyzing case studied focused on real world problems related with their future engineering professional profiles. A total of 52 students conducted the survey, where 19% were of second course, 10% were of third course, 19% were of fourth course, and 52% were of fifth course. Students were asked about contents of the Industrial Ecology Course, and they had to choose about a more theoretical background teaching in class, or an approximation to real world scenarios, choosing industry models involving ecology planning, and analyzing different problem solving, Environmental Impact Analysis (EIA) or legislation. The results obtained evidence that the interest on real-world scenarios increases in the last-year students, with a 45% of the students interested in realizing EIA analysis, whereas only 8% of the second course students choose this option. Likewise, the interest for master classes with a more theoretical background decreases from a 42% of the second-year students, to a 24% of the fifth year students. Also, only the fifth-year students showed interest in learning legislation software. From the results obtained it can be concluded that addressing real-world scenarios increases the interest of the students, as analyzing case studies based on real-world problems give to the students the opportunity to compare their solutions to what happened in the industry, using roleplaying and thereby simulating the decision-making scenario that occurred in the industry [2].",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cruz Freire, Jose/A-7834-2011; Devesa-Rey, Rosa/M-4166-2014","Devesa-Rey, Rosa/0000-0002-8000-3900",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"978-84-615-3324-4",NA,NA,NA,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5332","5335",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000317080005042","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This study examines nitrogen and carbon isotope compositions of the velvet belly lantern shark, Etmopterus spinax, one of the most impacted shark species in northeastern Atlantic fisheries as a result of accidental catches. E. spinax was sampled at four different locations, characterized by contrasting oceanographic and ecological conditions: the western Mediterranean Sea (near the Balearic Islands), the southern Iberian upwelling system, Rockall Trough and southwestern Norwegian fjords. Stomach content analysis revealed similar prey species among sites, with a diet dominated by Euphausiacea (mostly Meganyctiphanes norvegica) and an ontogenetic shift towards small teleost fishes, cephalopods or other crustaceans.

In particular, it has been observed that the high level of species diversity in grasslands has a positive effect on several ecosystem functions (e.g. productivity). Ecological models are useful tools for analyzing the interactions of different processes in grasslands, which are assumed to be the underlying drivers of this positive effect. In this paper we present a review of the main processes included in existing grassland models and discuss the strength and limitations of existing approaches in the context of biofuel production. Most of the existing models (a) focus solely on one or a few single species, (b) do not consider competition processes adequately, or (c) do not follow the individual's development in the grassland community. This hinders a detailed analysis of the mechanisms and conditions that govern the ecosystem functions that are relevant for biofuel production such as productivity, stability, and carbon fixation. To bridge this gap, we propose a concept for a novel individual-based grassland model for temperate regions. Our approach covers a high number of species/functional groups, above- and below-ground intra- and inter-specific competition for different resources (light, water, nitrogen, space), and disturbances (due to management or climate change). Hence, it could facilitate comprehensive mechanistic analyses of the dynamics of semi-natural grasslands and their efficiency in biofuel production. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We test a transcriptome-based approach in the European green crab (Carcinus maenas), a widespread invasive species with high gene flow and a well-known invasion history, in two native and five invasive populations. A panel of 10809 transcriptome-derived nuclear SNPs identified significant population structure among highly bottlenecked invasive populations that were previously undifferentiated with traditional markers. Comparing the full data set and a subset of 9246 putatively neutral SNPs strongly suggested that non-neutral processes are the primary driver of population structure within the species' native range, while neutral processes appear to dominate in the invaded range. Non-neutral native range structure coincides with significant differences in intraspecific thermal tolerance, suggesting temperature as a potential selective agent.

Yet few time series and high resolution spatial and temporal measurements exist to track the existence and movement of water low in pH and/or carbonate saturation. Past acidification monitoring efforts have either low spatial resolution (mooring) or high cost and low temporal and spatial resolution (research cruises). We developed the first integrated glider platform and sensor system for sampling pH throughout the water column of the coastal ocean. A deep ISFET (Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor)-based pH sensor system was modified and integrated into a Slocum glider, tank tested in natural seawater to determine sensor conditioning time under different scenarios, and validated in situ during deployments in the U.S. Northeast Shelf (NES). Comparative results between glider pH and pH measured spectrophotometrically from discrete seawater samples indicate that the glider pH sensor is capable of accuracy of 0.011 pH units or better for several weeks throughout the water column in the coastal ocean, with a precision of 0.005 pH units or better. Furthermore, simultaneous measurements from multiple sensors on the same glider enabled salinity-based estimates of total alkalinity (A(T)) and aragonite saturation state (Omega(Arag)). During the Spring 2018 Mid-Atlantic deployment, glider pH and derived A(T)/Omega(Arag) data along the cross-shelf transect revealed higher pH and Omega(Arag) associated with the depth of chlorophyll and oxygen maxima and a warmer, saltier water mass. Lowest pH and Omega(Arag) occurred in bottom waters of the middle shelf and slope, and nearshore following a period of heavy precipitation. Biofouling was revealed to be the primary limitation of this sensor during a summer deployment, whereby offsets in pH and A(T) increased dramatically. Advances in anti-fouling coatings and the ability to routinely clean and swap out sensors can address this challenge. The data presented here demonstrate the ability for gliders to routinely provide high resolution water column data on regional scales that can be applied to acidification monitoring efforts in other coastal regions.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cai, Wei-Jun/C-1361-2013; Miles, Travis/L-7918-2013","Miles, Travis/0000-0003-1992-0248; Cai, Wei-Jun/0000-0003-3606-8325; Wright-Fairbanks, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1265-6616; Branham, Charles/0000-0002-4012-6519",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2296-7745",NA,NA,NA,"OCT 30",2019,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"664","10.3389/fmars.2019.00664","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00664",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000493319500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While numerous studies highlight the inability of such areas to protect the full range of biodiversity, the procedures by which protected areas are created nevertheless remain understudied. A better understanding of the related policy processes is necessary to overcome the research-implementation gap and, hopefully, decrease biodiversity loss. This article seeks to fill this blind spot in conservation by conducting interdisciplinary research at the crossroads of ecology and policy studies. We applied mixed methods (i.e. quantitative and qualitative analysis) to the historical archives of national nature reserve (NNR) projects to identify the weight of scientific statements and other factors involved in the decision-making process. Our results reveal a two-step process. Scientific opinion about NNR projects operates as the primary filter. Then, another triage is made under social, political and economic interests. Such situation challenges the idea that more evidence would lead to better conservation. In our opinion, the key issue is to determine the ways to improve the success of NNR projects rather than improving data and algorithms. In this sense, we call for the implementation of an informed opportunism approach and suggest some leads to favor its practical application.

Microbial biodiversity plays key roles in many ecosystem services, including the support to biogeochemical cycles. However, despite great advances in the understanding of the role of soil microbiota in providing benefits to nature and humankind, there is still much knowledge to be gained from understudied areas across the globe. Indeed, underrepresentation of the Global South in ecological studies has been suggested as an important gap that could compromise global solutions to conservation and the current biodiversity and climate crisis. In the Southern hemisphere, the southwest of South America, which includes Chile, runs behind the rest of the continent on studies related to soil microbial diversity and ecosystem functions. Therefore, to gain a better understanding of the global biodiversity and environment crisis, essential perspectives and knowledge from underrepresented regions need to be acknowledged to avoid biases in the scientific community. The main objective of this work is to understand how soil microbial diversity has been studied in Chile and the Antarctic Peninsula since 1975 to identify main knowledge gaps and funding opportunities for future research. Our survey consists of 343 articles representing 1,335 sampling points from Continental Chile to the Antarctic Peninsula. It revealed a better representation of articles studying bacterial and fungal diversity in the extreme regions of Chile funded by both international funds and the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID). To study microbial diversity, cultivation-based methods are still the most commonly used, whereas molecular studies are increasing but insufficiently applied.

In response, this paper tackles the issue of climate risk and human wellbeing in Latin America from an emerging and innovative perspective: reparation ecology. Reparation is a heuristic category by means of which we systematize converging evidence about the responses of local Latin-American communities to severe socio-environmental crises that are closely connected to climate risks and to long-lasting threats to the wellbeing of human societies and ecosystems. The results focus on a comparative analysis of five case studies on nature-based urban adaptation in two low-income settlements in Brazil; local ecological governance led by actors from the organized civil society in Colombia; agroecological and just innovative food production systems in Ecuador and sustainable urban-rural food markets in Guatemala.

Developing these further, into a cosmopolitical direction, we propose studying EM as sets of socially and materially situated practices. This enables a shift away from established approaches which treat EM either as a toolbox whose efficiency has to be assessed, or as simply the implementation of dominant projects and the materialisation of hegemonic discourse.

Empirical tests have produced variable results, and the validity of MST is intensely debated. MST focuses on organisms' internal physiological mechanisms but we hypothesize that ecological interactions can be more important in determining plant mass-density relationships induced by density. We employ an individual-based model of plant stand development that includes three elements: a model of individual plant growth based on MST, different modes of local competition (size-symmetric vs. -asymmetric), and different resource levels. Our model is consistent with the observed variation in the slopes of self-thinning trajectories. Slopes were significantly shallower than -4/3 if competition was size-symmetric. We conclude that when the size of survivors is influenced by strong ecological interactions, these can override predictions of MST, whereas when surviving plants are less affected by interactions, individual-level metabolic processes can scale up to the population level.

By using anchored Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs or payao), the Philippine tuna fisheries was transformed into a million-dollar industry. Minimal studies on exploitation rates and fish behavior around anchored FADs hampered further understanding of this fishery practice. Studies on fish behavior using Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) are good complement where data is limited. A study using semi-structured interview (n = 46) and three focus group discussions (n = 39 participants) to record fishers' knowledge and observations on the behavior of different fish species around anchored FADs was conducted. This particularly focused on attraction, retention, and departure behavior of fishes in identified FAD sites. Based on the fishers knowledge, tuna schools are attracted to anchored FADs at 10 km distance. In anchored FADs, tuna form schools segregated by species and size. There was no relationship between the attraction distance and the reported school size and the various waiting times for fish to aggregate below the FADs. There was no variation between the species present at day or night time although fishers have reported a distinction of species found near the surface (0-10 m) and those found at other depths (11-20 m).

These indices are indeed usually considered as proxies of energy reserves, ignoring other physiological processes involved in animal health such as nutritional, immune and hormonal states. Given the wide variety of ecological processes investigated through morphometric body condition indices in marine sciences, there is a clear need to determine whether morphometric indices reflect primarily individuals' energy reserves or their broader integrated physiological status. To address this issue, we used morphometric and physiological data (cortisol level, oxidative stress, digestive enzymes activity, and both fatty acids percentage and total amount) collected in three stocks of the European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) presenting contrasted patterns of growth and body condition. We found that morphometric body condition indices are indeed mainly and consistently linked to a proxy of the amount of lipid reserves (i.e., fatty acids amount), but also significantly to quality of lipid reserves (i.e., fatty acids percentage) and fish chronic stress (scale cortisol levels). We found no significant relationship between morphometric indices of body condition and both oxidative stress proxies and variables measuring digestive enzymes activity. Our study confirmed that morphometric body condition indices primarily reflect the variance in individuals' lipid reserves and to a lesser extent the actual composition of these reserves (linked to differences in fish diet) and scale cortisol levels (indicating fish metabolism and/or their chronic stress levels). Therefore, some non-energetic aspects should be considered when studying individuals' responses to environmental changes and other key physiological processes (oxidative stress proxies, activity of digestive enzymes) should be investigated directly to support scientific-based decision-making in the context of climate change.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Brosset, Pablo/AAA-3148-2021; Mathieu-Resuge, Margaux/AAW-4299-2021; Lebigre, Christophe/JAC-8468-2023","Brosset, Pablo/0000-0002-2561-6560; Lebigre, Christophe/0000-0001-6119-2534; Schull, Quentin/0000-0001-9297-3376",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1470-160X","1872-7034",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2023,154,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"110860","10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110860","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110860",NA,"AUG 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001079997400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We currently lack understanding of how such dynamic feedbacks affect the growth dynamics of individual microbes and of the community as a whole. Here we study how interactions mediated by the exchange of metabolites through the environment change over time within a simple marine microbial community. We used a microfluidic-based approach that allows us to disentangle the effect cells have on their environment from how they respond to their environment. We found that the interactions between two species-a degrader of chitin and a cross-feeder that consumes metabolic by-products-changes dynamically over time as cells modify their environment. Cells initially interact positively and then start to compete at later stages of growth. Our results demonstrate that interactions between microorganisms are not static and depend on the state of the environment, emphasizing the importance of disentangling how modifications of the environment affects species interactions.

However, the effects of biogeography and evolutionary history on trait-matching and trait-mediated resource specialization remain poorly understood. We compiled a database of 93 mutualistic hummingbird-plant networks (including 181 hummingbird and 1,256 plant species), complemented by morphological measures of hummingbird bill and floral corolla length. We divided the hummingbirds into their principal clades and used knowledge on hummingbird biogeography to divide the networks into four biogeographical regions: Lowland South America, Andes, North & Central America, and the Caribbean islands. We then tested: (a) whether hummingbird clades and biogeographical regions differ in hummingbird bill length, corolla length of visited flowers and resource specialization, and (b) whether hummingbirds' bill length correlates with the corolla length of their food plants and with their level of resource specialization. Hummingbird clades dominated by long-billed species generally visited longer flowers and were the most exclusive in their resource use. Bill and corolla length and the degree of resource specialization were similar across mainland regions, but the Caribbean islands had shorter flowers and hummingbirds with more generalized interaction niches. Bill and corolla length correlated in all regions and most clades, that is, trait-matching was a recurrent phenomenon in hummingbird-plant associations. In contrast, bill length did not generally mediate resource specialization, as bill length was only weakly correlated with resource specialization within one hummingbird clade (Brilliants) and in the regions of Lowland South America and the Andes in which plants and hummingbirds have a long co-evolutionary history. Supplementary analyses including bill curvature confirmed that bill morphology (length and curvature) does not in general predict resource specialization. These results demonstrate how biogeographical and evolutionary histories can modulate the effects of functional traits on species interactions, and that traits better predict functional groups of interaction partners (i.e. trait-matching) than resource specialization. These findings reveal that functional traits have great potential, but also key limitations, as a tool for developing more mechanistic approaches in community ecology.

To develop this framework, we examined the current ecological condition of a culturally and commercially valuable species, considered the predicted future effects of climate change on that species in a protected area, and assessed the perspectives held by forest users and managers on future adaptive practices. We mapped the distribution of yellow-cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis) and examined its health status in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve by comparing forest structure, tree stress-indicators, and associated thermal regimes between forests inside the park and forests at the current latitudinal limit of the species dieback. Yellow-cedar trees inside the park were healthy and relatively unstressed compared to trees outside the park that exhibited reduced crown fullness and increased foliar damage. Considering risk factors for mortality under future climate scenarios, our vulnerability model indicated future expected dieback occurring within park boundaries. Interviews with forest users and managers revealed strong support for increasing monitoring to inform interventions outside protected areas, improving management collaboration across land designations, and using a portfolio of interventions on actively managed lands. Study participants who perceived humans as separate from nature were more opposed to interventions in protected areas.

While mature individuals are known to have extended longitudinal movements of over 90km along main river channels, details of the seasonal movements and residency of individuals within and between tributary habitats have been largely undocumented. Therefore, the current research aimed to detect and quantify the seasonal distances moved by adult taimen (65-96cm; n=10) within and between the Onon River (Amur River basin) and a major tributary (Balj) over 12 months using passive acoustic telemetry. The median distance moved by taimen in spring was 17.4km (n=6), in summer 9.1km (n=4), autumn 4.7km (n=9) and winter 0.4km (n=8). However, there were no statically significant differences amongst these median seasonal home range sizes. Two taimen traversed between the Onon River and the Balj tributary during the study period, recording overall home ranges of 44.5km and 126.1km. One of these individuals moved twice, exiting the tributary in autumn and returning again in spring where it remained for 36 days, while the second taimen moved only once into the tributary in spring and re-entered the main channel in late summer after 85 days. Another two taimen entered surrounding smaller tributaries and recorded home ranges of 26.1km and 29.2km, while all remaining individuals were detected moving only within the waterway where they were originally captured and released (0.8-20.1km). Taimen movements within tributaries such as the Balj can be extensive (<60km), as they provide access to important spawning, feeding and overwintering habitats as well as refuge from adverse thermal and hydrological conditions.

In parts of Europe, bark beetle outbreaks and efforts to manage them have even triggered social unrests and political instability. These events have increasingly challenged traditional responses to outbreaks, and highlight the need for a more comprehensive management framework. Recent Findings Several synthesis papers on different aspects of bark beetle ecology and management exist. However, our understanding of outbreak drivers and impacts, principles of ecosystem management, governance, and the role of climate change in the dynamics of ecological and social systems has rapidly advanced in recent years. These advances are suggesting a reconsideration of previous management strategies. We synthesize the state of knowledge on drivers and impacts of bark beetle outbreaks in Europe and propose a comprehensive context-dependent framework for their management. We illustrate our ideas for two contrasting societal objectives that represent the end-members of a continuum of forest management goals: wood and biomass production and the conservation of biodiversity and natural processes. For production forests, we propose a management approach addressing economic, social, ecological, infrastructural, and legislative aspects of bark beetle disturbances. In conservation forests, where non-intervention is the default option, we elaborate under which circumstances an active intervention is necessary, and whether such an intervention is in conflict with the objective to conserve biodiversity.

Adjusting migration timing to match ecosystem phenology is key to survival in dynamic and changing ecosystems, especially in an era of human-induced rapid environmental change. Social cues are increasingly recognized as major components of migratory behaviour, yet a comprehensive understanding of how social cues influence the timing of animal migrations remains elusive. Here, we introduce a framework for assessing the role that social cues, ranging from explicit (for example, active cueing) to implicit (for example, competition), play in animals' temporal migration decisions across a range of scales. By applying this theoretical lens to a systematic review of published literature, we show that a broad range of social cues frequently mediate migration timing at a range of temporal scales and across highly diverse migratory taxa. We further highlight that while rarely documented, several social cue mechanisms (for example, social learning and density dependency) play important adaptive roles in matching migration timing with ecosystem dynamics. Thus, social cues play a fundamental role in migration timing, with potentially widespread ecological consequences and implications for the conservation of migratory species.

To elucidate how these resources affect fungal communities in an arable soil, a field experiment was set up with two plant species, maize and wheat. Resource availability was experimentally manipulated by maize litter input on one half of these maize and wheat plots after harvest in autumn. Fungal biomass was determined by ergosterol quantification, and community structure was investigated by fungal automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (F-ARISA). An annual cycle was assessed across a depth gradient, distinguishing three soil habitats: the plough layer, rooted soil below the plough layer, and deeper root-free soil. Fungal communities appeared highly dynamic and varied according to soil depth and plant resources. In the plough layer, the availability of litter played a dominant role in shaping fungal communities, whereas in the rooted layer below, community structure and biomass mainly differed between plant species. This plant effect was also extended into the root-free soil at a depth of 70 cm. In winter, the availability of litter also affected fungal communities in deeper soil layers, suggesting vertical transport processes under fallow conditions.

We explore the interconnected SETS of the infrastructure problem in the US through comparative case studies of green infrastructure (GI) development in Portland and Baltimore. Currently a popular infrastructure solution to a wide variety of urban ills, GI is the use and mimicry of ecological components (e.g., plants) to perform municipal services (e.g., stormwater management).

The eco-techno spectrum becomes a platform to explore the institutional knowledge system dynamics of GI development where social dimensions are organized across ecological and technological aspects of GI, exposing how governance differs across specific forms of ecological and technological hybridity. In this study, we highlight the knowledge system challenges of urban planning institutions as a key consideration in the realization of innovative infrastructure crisis 'fixes.'

This study explored potentials of habitat heterogeneity enhancement in SUDS using structural heterogeneity as a proxy for biodiversity potential. In an interdisciplinary workshop, landscape architects and urban ecologists designed individual SUDS elements with enhanced structural habitat heterogeneity, hereafter bio-SUDS. The redesigned SUDS elements were infiltration trench, curb extension, rain garden, swale, wet basin, and dry basin. To evaluate the bio-SUDS designs, we developed an index of habitat heterogeneity in SUDS based on registration of 45 structurally important components. The conversion from standard SUDS to bio-SUDS entailed substantial increases in structural heterogeneity ranging from 4 to 18 additional components within elements. Larger bio-SUDS elements returned higher index scores, but the relative score increases were substantial for all bio-SUDS and in the range of a factor of 2-5.5. Increased terrain differences, meandering edges, stones, gravel, boulders, deadwood, and brown roof-like vegetation were the components most often employed in the bio-SUDS designs.

An Andean native potato landrace was grown in a greenhouse under Fe limitation and using three levels (Low, Medium, High) of foliar fertilization (FeEDDHA). Application occurred at 45, 60 and 70 days of growth corresponding to periods where Fe limitation is expected to be greatest. The rhizosphere soils were sampled at the flowering stage (80 days). Soil bacterial and fungal communities were examined using high-throughput sequencing of 16S and ITS regions of ribosomal RNA gene, respectively, followed by analysis using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME v1.8). Multivariate data analyses showed that Fe fertilization of leaves significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the beta diversity of fungi but not bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. Using our novel approach, it was expected and confirmed that fungal communities would shift and mycorrhizal genera (Glomus) would be altered, however, the degree to which community change was observed was more than expected. Glomeromycota (-16.3%) related to the family Gigasporaceae accounted for 2.8% of OTU and were 2-3 times greater in the rhizosphere of high relative to medium and low Fe conditions.

However, the establishment of water and sediment standards or management actions in brackish systems has been difficult because of the inherent transdisciplinary nature of estuarine processes. According to the European Commission, integrative comprehension of fate and effects of contaminants in different compartments of these transitional environments (estuarine sediment, water, biota) is still required to better establish, assess and monitor the good ecological status targeted by the Water Framework Directive. Thus, the present study proposes a holistic overview and conceptual model for the environmental fate of metals and their toxicity effects on aquatic organisms in estuaries. This includes the analysis and integration of biogeochemical processes and parameters, metal chemistry and organism physiology. Sources of particulate and dissolved metal, hydrodynamics, water chemistry, and mechanisms of toxicity are discussed jointly in a multidisciplinary manner. It is also hypothesized how these different drivers of metal behaviour might interact and affect metal concentrations in diverse media, and the knowledge gaps and remaining research challenges are pointed. Ultimately, estuarine physicochemical gradients, biogeochemical processes, and organism physiology are jointly coordinating the fate and potential effects of metals in estuaries, and both realistic model approaches and attempts to postulate site-specific water criteria or water/sediment standards must consider such interdisciplinary interactions.

Gene expression ceases slowly over approximately 100 generations in the absence of tetrachloroethene (PCE). However, the molecular mechanisms of this regulation process are not understood. We show here that Sulfurospirillum halorespirans undergoes the same type of regulation when cultivated without chlorinated ethenes for a long period of time. In addition, we compared the proteomes of S. halorespirans cells cultivated in the presence of PCE with those of cells long- and short-term cultivated with nitrate as the sole electron acceptor. Important OHR-related proteins previously unidentified in S. multivorans include a histidine kinase, a putative quinol dehydrogenase membrane protein, and a PCE-induced porin. Since for some regulatory proteins a posttranslational regulation of activity by lysine acetylations is known, we also analyzed the acetylome of S. halorespirans, revealing that 32% of the proteome was acetylated in at least one condition. The data indicate that the response regulator and the histidine kinase of a two-component system most probably involved in induction of PCE respiration are highly acetylated during short-term cultivation with nitrate in the absence of PCE. Significance: The so far unique long-term downregulation of organohalide respiration is now identified in a second species suggesting a broader distribution of this regulatory phenomenon. An improved protein extraction method allowed the identification of proteins most probably involved in transcriptional regulation of OHR in Sulfurospirillum spp. Our data indicate that acetylations of regulatory proteins are involved in this extreme, sustained standby-mode of metabolic enzymes in the absence of a substrate.

Theoretical and empirical ecology has transitioned from a focus on the role of negative interactions in species coexistence to a more pluralistic view that acknowledges that coexistence in natural communities is more complex, and depends on species interactions that vary in strength, sign, and reciprocity, and such contexts as the environment and life-history stage. 2. We used a whole-community approach to examine how species interactions contribute to the maintenance of a rocky intertidal macroalgal canopy-understorey assemblage. We determined both the types of interactions in this network, and whether interactions were sensitive to environmental gradients. 3. Focusing on a structurally dominant canopy kelp Saccharina sessilis, and its diverse co-occurring understorey assemblage, we evaluated the role of the understorey in controlling S. sessilis recruitment and quantified the reciprocal effect of the S. sessilis canopy and understorey on one another using a removal experiment replicated across 600 km of coastline. We determined the sensitivity of interactions to natural variation in light and nutrient availability (replicated among four regions on the N.E. Pacific coast), and under different wave conditions (three wave regimes). 4. Surprisingly, species interactions were similar across sites and thus not context-dependent. Unexpectedly, the understorey community had a strong positive effect on the S. sessilis canopy, whereby the adult canopy decreased dramatically following understorey removal. Additionally, S. sessilis recruitment depended on the presence of understorey coralline algal turf. In turn, the canopy had a neutral effect on the coralline understorey, but a negative effect on non-calcifying algal turfs, likely eventually generating positive indirect canopy effects on the coralline understorey. Density-dependent intraspecific competition between S. sessilis adults and recruits may moderate this positive feedback between the S. sessilis canopy and coralline understorey. 5. Synthesis.

Chemosensation requires animals to decipher a complex chemical background to locate fitness-related resources, and thus the underlying genomic architecture and morphology must cope with constant exposure to a changing odorant landscape; detecting adaptation amidst extensive chemosensory diversity is an open challenge. In phyllostomid bats, an ecologically diverse clade that evolved plant visiting from a presumed insectivorous ancestor, the evolution of novel food detection mechanisms is suggested to be a key innovation, as plant-visiting species rely strongly on olfaction, supplementarily using echolocation. If this is true, exceptional variation in underlying olfactory genes and phenotypes may have preceded dietary diversification. We compared olfactory receptor (OR) genes sequenced from olfactory epithelium transcriptomes and olfactory epithelium surface area of bats with differing diets. Surprisingly, although OR evolution rates were quite variable and generally high, they are largely independent of diet. Olfactory epithelial surface area, however, is relatively larger in plant-visiting bats and there is an inverse relationship between OR evolution rates and surface area. Relatively larger surface areas suggest greater reliance on olfactory detection and stronger constraint on maintaining an already diverse OR repertoire.

Understanding the microbial ecology of disease vectors is important in the development of vector management strategies that target vector survival and fitness. In this study we examined the whole-body microbial composition of R. pallescens from three locations in Panama. Methods: We collected 89 R. pallescens specimens using Noireau traps in Attalea butyracea palms. We then extracted total DNA from whole-bodies of specimens and amplified bacterial microbiota using 16S rRNA metabarcoding PCR. The 16S libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq and analyzed using QIIME2 software. Results: We found Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes to be the most abundant bacterial phyla across all samples. Geographical location showed the largest difference in microbial composition with northern Veraguas Province having the most diversity and Panama Oeste Province localities being most similar to each other. Wolbachia was detected in high abundance (48-72%) at Panama Oeste area localities with a complete absence of detection in Veraguas Province.

While overall the microbiota has bacterial taxa consistent with previous studies in triatomine microbial ecology, locality differences are an important observation for future studies.

Recent advancements in DNA sequencing and sediment dating have enabled the reconstruction of past flora dynamics from ancient plant DNA extracted from lake sediment samples. In this study, we investigated the invasion of Azolla species within Dal Lake, India, employing an integrated approach of environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis with Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating. The introduction and accurate identification of Azolla in Dal Lake have posed persistent challenges amidst its considerable negative impact on the ecosystem. By employing this integrated methodology, we were able to construct the temporal trajectory of Azolla's introduction within the Dal Lake ecosystem. Sediment coring was conducted in 2022 within Dal Lake, and to establish chronology, sediment dating was performed using Pb-210 and Cs-137, revealing sedimentation rates of 0.63 cm/year and 0.86 cm/year, respectively. The eDNA analysis involved extracting Azolla DNA from lake sediments, its PCR amplification using rbcL primers, followed by DNA sequencing and BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search to refine taxonomic resolution. Analysis of sediment cores dating back to 1925 revealed the presence of Azolla DNA beginning around 1979, persisting to the present, indicating its continual presence in Dal Lake. DNA sequenced from the deepest lake sediment layers identified A. pinnata and A. filiculoides as the first invaders, while DNA of other Azolla species such as A. mexicana, A. microphylla, A. rubra, A. nilotica, and A. caroliniana, was detected from subsequent layers. This approach confirmed the first occurrence of Azolla in Dal Lake and provided insights into species composition changes over time.

With swift advancements in the fields of genomics and genetic manipulations, identifying the regulators of wing development and mimetic wing patterns has become feasible even in nonmodel organisms such as butterflies. Recent mapping and gene expression studies have identified single switch loci of major effects such as transcription factors and supergenes as the main drivers of adaptive evolution of mimetic and polymorphic butterfly wing patterns. We highlight several of these examples, with emphasis on doublesex, optix, WntA and other dynamic, yet essential, master regulators that control critical color variation and sex-specific traits. Co-option emerges as a predominant theme, where typically embryonic and other early-stage developmental genes and networks have been rewired to regulate polymorphic and sex-limited mimetic wing patterns in iconic butterfly adaptations. Drawing comparisons from our knowledge of wing development in Drosophila, we illustrate the functional space of genes that have been recruited to regulate butterfly wing patterns. We also propose a developmental pathway that potentially results in dorsoventral mismatch in butterfly wing patterns. Such dorsoventrally mismatched color patterns modulate signal components of butterfly wings that are used in intra- and inter-specific communication. Recent advancesfuelled by RNAi-mediated knockdowns and CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic editsin the developmental genetics of butterfly wing patterns, and the underlying biological diversity and complexity of wing coloration, are pushing butterflies as an emerging model system in ecological genetics and evolutionary developmental biology.

Here, non-invasive genetic capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methods have become a very important tool to estimate population parameters, such as population size and sex ratio. The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) is such an elusive species of management concern and is increasingly studied using faecal-based genetic sampling. For unbiased sex ratios or population size estimates, the marking behaviour of otters has to be taken into account. Using 2132 otter faeces of a wild otter population in Upper Lusatia (Saxony, Germany) collected over six years (2006-2012), we studied the marking behaviour and applied closed population CMR models accounting for genetic mis-identification to estimate population sizes and sex ratios. We detected a sex difference in the marking behaviour of otters with jelly samples being more often defecated by males and placed actively exposed on frequently used marking sites. Since jelly samples are of higher DNA quality, it is important to not only concentrate on this kind of samples or marking sites and to invest in sufficiently high numbers of repetitions of non-jelly samples to ensure an unbiased sex ratio. Furthermore, otters seemed to increase marking intensity due to the handling of their spraints, hence accounting for this behavioural response could be important. We provided the first precise population size estimate with confidence intervals for Upper Lusatia (for 2012: (N) over cap = 20 +/- 2.1, 95% CI = 16-25) and showed that spraint densities are not a reliable index for abundances.

Active subsidies are animal-transported resources (e.g., nutrients, detritus, prey) or consumers (e.g., predators, parasites, pathogens) across ecosystem boundaries and can affect ecosystem function. Animal movement has been shown to affect the spatial distributions of active subsidies. However, there is limited research on how conspecific interaction affects active subsidy distributions through animal movement. Based on dispersal from a donor to recipient ecosystem, we constructed a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) to quantify the effect of variation in conspecific interaction in three scenarios (attraction, avoidance, no interaction) and movement behavior as a correlated random walk on living and dead subsidy displacement, density, and clustering. In each conspecific interaction scenario, we examined emergent subsidy distributions from varying the straightness of movement path and the settlement probability as a function of settled conspecifics within dispersers' perceptual range. Movement behavior predicted subsidy displacement, and conspecific interaction determined subsidy density and clustering patterns. We found that avoidance spread subsidies farther and at lower densities in the recipient ecosystem, generating more spread-out dead subsidy clusters. Attraction resulted in fewer, smaller, and denser living subsidy clusters closer to the ecosystem boundary. Higher settlement probability constrained living subsidy displacement with increased subsidy density and clustering across conspecific interaction scenarios. Subsidy density and clustering increased with perceptual range in attraction scenarios, limiting subsidy displacement. Subsidy displacement increased with perceptual range in avoidance scenarios, reducing subsidy density and clustering.

Our analysis revealed unique community structure, dominant Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and underrepresented Bacteroides, of Indian and Chinese gut bacteria.

Therefore, we hypothesized that enrichment of these bacterial clades is supported by high consumption of starch-rich diet such as rice, potato, refined grains. The dominance of genus Bifidobacterium due to carbohydrate-rich diet is another notable feature of this study. Moreover, Indian gut bacteria are significantly represented by Bacteroidetes (p = 0.001) and Prevotella (p = 0.002) in contrast to Chinese, which could be associated with whole grains and plant-based vegetarian diet of Indians.

These remains represent effective sources and tools for studying (i) pre-industrial pressures on forest resources and (ii) past strategies related to woodland management. However, radiocarbon dating (AMS), which is the main tool to reconstruct the chronology of past charcoal manufacturing activity, doesn't provide sufficiently accurate dating, especially for the post-1650 period, due to the broad probability range of the dates resulting from wiggles in the calibration curve. In order to overcome the radiocarbon dating limitation and therefore refine the chronology of modern charcoal manufacturing, this paper proposes to apply an integrated approach combining archaeology, micromorphology, anthracology and dendrochronology. To characterise the archaeological record of a target charcoal kiln terrace from the Foret de Bernadouze, located in a historical iron production valley of the Northern Pyrenees, we combined classical stratigraphic analysis with a micromorphological study. The results highlight the multiperiod nature of the terrace, i.e. a palimpsest of multiple charcoal production episodes, revealing two major phases marked by an abandonment period between them. Subsequently, we constructed a beech charcoal-ring (n = 49) chronology cross-dated with the new Foret de Bernadouze reference chronology from freshly felled, living beech trees (n = 24) to obtain the annual resolution of charcoal ring formation. Based on the new reconstructed master chronology covering the 1879-2016 period, we were able to calibrate the charcoal-ring chronology for the 1881-1941 period. Consequently, we (i) dated the charcoal production activity performed on the target terrace during the 1924-1942 period and (ii) identified a shift in the rate of use of the terrace, from one-off to high-intensive use.

At downstream sites, receiving waters were additionally grab sampled for five selected pharmaceuticals. Ecological effects on macroinvertebrate structure and ecosystem function were assessed using the biological indicator system SPEAR(pesticides) (SPEcies At Risk) and leaf litter breakdown rates, respectively. WWTP effluents substantially increased insecticide and fungicide concentrations in receiving waters; in many cases, treated wastewater was the exclusive source for the neonicotinoid insecticides acetamiprid and imidacloprid in the investigated streams. During the ten weeks of the investigation, five out of the seven WWTPs increased in-stream pesticide toxicity by a factor of three. As a consequence, at downstream sites, SPEAR values and leaf litter degradation rates were reduced by 40% and 53%, respectively. The reduced leaf litter breakdown was related to changes in the macroinvertebrate communities described by SPEARpesticides and not to altered microbial activity. Neonicotinoids showed the highest ecological relevance for the composition of invertebrate communities, occasionally exceeding the Regulatory Acceptable Concentrations (RACs). In general, considerable ecological effects of insecticides were observed above and below regulatory thresholds. Fungicides, herbicides and pharmaceuticals contributed only marginally to acute toxicity. We conclude that pesticide retention of WWTPs needs to be improved. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, few comparative studies on plant distribution have assessed these traits simultaneously. Pollinator richness and frequency of visits, autonomous self-pollination ability, reproductive output (i.e., reproductive traits), seed bank strategy and seedling density (i.e., regenerative traits) were compared between the narrowly distributed Ipomoea rubriflora O'Donnell (Convolvulaceae) and its widespread congener Ipomoea purpurea (L.) Roth. The narrowly distributed species showed higher ecological specialization to pollinators and lower autonomous self-pollination ability. Frequency of visits, natural seed/ovule ratio and fruit set, and total fruit production did not differ between species. However, the number of seeds produced per fruit was lower in the narrowly distributed species, translating into lower total seed production per plant. Indeed, I. rubriflora formed smaller transient and persistent seed banks and showed lower seedling density than the widespread I. purpurea. These reproductive and regenerative trait results suggest that the narrowly distributed species may have lower colonization and persistence ability than its widespread congener. They further suggest that the negative effects of lower fecundity in the narrowly distributed species might persist in time through the long-lasting effects of total seed production on seed bank size, reducing the species' ability to buffered environmental stochasticity. However, other regenerative traits, such as seed size, and processes such as pre- and post-dispersal seed predation, might modulate the effects of plant fecundity on plant colonization and persistence ability and thus range size.

The conventional view is that all antibiotic resistance is problematic, even when not in pathogens. Resistance in commensal bacteria poses risks, as resistant organisms can provide a reservoir of resistance genes that can be horizontally transferred to pathogens or may themselves cause opportunistic infections in the future. While these risks are real, we propose that commensal resistance can also generate benefits during antibiotic treatment of human infection, by promoting continued ecological suppression of pathogens. To define and illustrate this alternative conceptual perspective, we use a two-species mathematical model to identify the necessary and sufficient ecological conditions for beneficial resistance. We show that the benefits are limited to species (or strain) interactions where commensals suppress pathogen growth and are maximized when commensals compete with, rather than prey on or otherwise exploit pathogens. By identifying benefits of commensal resistance, we propose that rather than strictly minimizing all resistance, resistance management may be better viewed as an optimization problem. We discuss implications in two applied contexts: bystander (nontarget) selection within commensal microbiomes and pathogen treatment given polymicrobial infections.IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance is commonly viewed as universally costly, regardless of which bacterial cells express resistance. Here, we derive an opposing logic, where resistance in commensal bacteria can lead to reductions in pathogen density and improved outcomes on both the patient and public health scales. We use a mathematical model of commensal-pathogen interactions to define the necessary and sufficient conditions for beneficial resistance, highlighting the importance of reciprocal ecological inhibition to maximize the benefits of resistance.

One viable monitoring option is the use of airborne laser scanning (LiDAR), which enables estimating forest structure parameters over large areas in a reduced timeframe with high accuracy. In this study, we propose and assess the applicability of five monitoring indicators for RIL based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data acquisition in areas under forest concession. Five Annual Production Units (APUs) were investigated within the Forest Management Unit (FMU) III of the Jamari National Forest, located in the Southwest of the Brazilian Amazon. These sites were surveyed by LiDAR in 2014 and 2015 (one year after the exploration). Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), Surface Models (DSMs), and Canopy Height Models (CHMs) were generated for each APU. The proposed indicators were: i. Detection and identification of crown removal in dominant and co -dominant trees above 30 m; ii. Gap detection in the forest canopy; iii. Impacts of Reduced Impact Logging on the Understory; iv. Changes in the vertical canopy profile; and v. Affected areas within Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs) and restricted areas. There was a 3.95% reduction in the occurrence of taller canopies after RIL, and a higher occurrence of small gaps (lambda > 1), with lambda values (2.34) being higher in the area with the oldest logging history (APU 1). Gini coefficient values in all APUs were below 0.5, indicating a low intensity of disturbances in the forest canopy. The shape (gamma) and scale (beta) parameters of the understory and canopy were not significantly correlated with variables related to selective logging. Restricted areas were considered for the allocation of roads, trails, log landings, and places with slopes equal to or >15%, and the indices of areas affected by RIL in PPAs and restricted areas were <2%.

This study used an expert opinion methodology to identify linkages between 22 ES and 14 GI types within a New York City context. An analysis of results from five interdisciplinary workshops engaging 46 academic experts reveals that expert judgement of ES benefits is highest for larger green spaces, which are not universally considered for stormwater management, and lowest for vacant land and non-vegetated GI types. Overall, cultural services were identified as those most universally provided by GI. The results of this study highlight potential significant variations in ES benefits between different GI types, and indicate the importance of considering cultural services in future GI research and planning efforts.

Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), a hormonal marker of ovarian reserve, may be a useful tool to clarify these questions. We describe AMH in a cohort of Filipino young adult women, and evaluate whether ovarian reserve in early adulthood relates to measures of life history scheduling (menarcheal age) and reproductive effort (parity). Methods: Data and samples are obtained from 294 nonpregnant participants (21.5 years +/- 0.3) in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. Plasma AMH was assayed using an enzyme immunoassay and relationships between AMH, menarcheal age, and parity were examined. Results: Mean AMH was 4.3 ng/mL. In multiple regression models, women who experienced menarche earlier had significantly higher AMH as young adults (P < 0.05). Women with two (P < 0.05) and three or more (P < 0.01) children had significantly lower AMH than those with no children. These associations were independent of age, smoking, and body mass index. Conclusions: These findings suggest that individual variation in life history scheduling and reproductive history could contribute to variation in ovarian reserve. Moreover, they demonstrate the utility of AMH as a tool for human reproductive ecology, and highlight the need for further research clarifying the extent of human population variation in ovarian reserve and the behavioral and ecological influences underlying this variation.

While the resulting development of pesticide resistance in agricultural pest species is well-known, reports on the extent of adaptation in exposed nontarget species are contradictory. These contradictory reports highlight a continuing challenge in understanding the relevant ecological mechanisms that facilitate or hinder adaptation to toxicants in the field. Here we show that species diversity hinders the adaptation to toxicants. In agricultural streams with low diversity, we observed an up to 8-fold increase in insecticide tolerance in a total of 17 macroinvertebrate species that was not observed in more diverse communities under similar contamination. High species diversity occurred independently from adjacent nonpolluted refuge areas. Therefore, the low level of adaptation in diverse streams cannot be explained by an increased recolonization of sensitive individuals from refuge areas. Instead, high intraspecific competition may facilitate the selection for increased tolerance in low-diverse communities. In diverse communities, by contrast, species interactions may reduce intraspecific competition and, thus, the potential for developing toxicant resistance. We suggest that this mechanism may be the general case in adaptation to environmental stressors.

Yet, seldom are parents observed across multiple reproductive bouts, with few studies considering anthropogenic disturbances as an ecological driver of maternal effects. We observed captive coyote (Canis latrans) pairs over two successive litters to determine whether among-litter differences in behavior (i.e., risk-taking) and hormones (i.e., cortisol and testosterone) corresponded with parental plasticity in habituation. Thus, we explicitly test the hypothesis that accumulating experiences of anthropogenic disturbance reduces parental fear across reproductive bouts, which should have disparate phenotypic consequences for first- and second-litter offspring. To quantify risk-taking behavior, we used foraging assays from 5-15 weeks of age with a human observer present as a proxy for human disturbance. At 5, 10, and 15 weeks of age, we collected shaved hair to quantify pup hormone levels. We then used a quantitative genetic approach to estimate heritability, repeatability, and between-trait correlations. We found that parents were riskier (i.e., foraged more frequently) with their second versus first litters, supporting our prediction that parents become increasingly habituated over time. Second-litter pups were also less risk-averse than their first-litter siblings.

Lastly, we found evidence of positive phenotypic and cohort correlations among pup traits, implying that cohort identity (i.e., common environment) contributes to the development of phenotypic syndromes in coyote pups.

Some exemplary systems are ultracold atoms, telomeres in the nucleus of cells, moisture transport in cement-based materials, arthropods' free movement, and birds' migration patterns. The characterization of the diffusion gives critical information about the dynamics of these systems and provides an interdisciplinary framework with which to study diffusive transport. Thus, the problem of identifying underlying diffusive regimes and inferring the anomalous diffu-sion exponent alpha with high confidence is critical to physics, chemistry, biology, and ecology. Classification and analysis of raw trajectories combining machine learning techniques with statistics extracted from them have widely been studied in the Anomalous Diffusion Challenge [Munoz-Gil et al. , Nat. Commun. 12 , 6253 (2021)]. Here we present a new data-driven method for working with diffusive trajectories. This method utilizes Gramian angular fields (GAF) to encode one-dimensional trajectories as images (Gramian matrices), while preserving their spatiotemporal structure for input to computer-vision models. This allows us to leverage two well-established pretrained computer-vision models, ResNet and MobileNet, to characterize the underlying diffusive regime and infer the anomalous diffusion exponent alpha. Short raw trajectories of lengths between 10 and 50 are commonly encountered in single-particle tracking experiments and are the most difficult ones to characterize. We show that GAF images can outperform the current state-of-the-art while increasing accessibility to machine learning methods in an applied setting.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sebastia, Laura/AAD-5160-2019; Conejero, J.

Anticipating bloom occurrence and understanding the main drivers of CyanoHABs are needed to optimize water resources management. An extensive review of the application of CyanoHABs forecasting and predictive models was performed, and a summary of the current state of knowledge, limitations and research opportunities on this topic is provided through analysis of case studies. Two modelling approaches were used to achieve CyanoHABs anticipation; process-based (PB) and data-driven (DD) models. The objective of the model was a determining factor for the choice of modelling approach. PB models were more frequently used to predict future scenarios whereas DD models were employed for short-term forecasts. Each modelling approach presented multiple variations that may be applied for more specific, targeted purposes. Most models reviewed were site-specific. The monitoring methodologies, including data frequency, uncertainty and precision, were identified as a major limitation to improve model performance. A lack of standardization of both model output and performance metrics was observed. CyanoHAB modelling is an interdisciplinary topic and communication between disciplines should be improved to facilitate model comparisons. These shortcomings can hinder the adoption of modelling tools by practitioners. We suggest that water managers should focus on generalising models for lakes with similar characteristics and where possible use high frequency monitoring for model development and validation.

In sympatry, high mountain systems potentially provide opportunities for ecological speciation along altitudinal belts and via polyploidy. However, the role of habitat and cytotype differentiation as isolation mechanisms is poorly understood. We developed a well-resolved phylogenetic framework for a clade of 34 North American and Central Asian mountain Ranunculi to reconstruct sister relationships and ecogeographical patterns. Based on seven DNA sequence markers (ITS of nrDNA, rpl32-trnl, trnT-trnL, ndhA intron, petL-psbE, trnV-ndhC, matK/trnK, and the psbJ-petA intergenic spacer) we utilized Maximum Likelihood and NeighborNet analyses. Data on habitat, altitude and ploidy levels were mapped onto the phylogenetic tree by using Mesquite analysis, and ecological differentiation was tested by habitat contrasts of sister species and by pairwise matching analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five well supported geographical subclades (two in North America, each one in Southern Central Asia, northern Central Asia/Arctic and in European/Asian lowland). The North American sister species exhibit allopatric, parapatric and sympatric distributions and represent even in sympatry distinct genetic clusters with some degree of habitat and/or cytotype differentiation. In the Himalayas and in the mountains of Taiwan all sister taxa occur in sympatry and form multiple genetic clusters; habitat differentiation is significantly lower than in North America, while cytotype diversity is poorly documented. In the temperate to arctic mountains of North America, ecological differentiation along altitudinal belts and/or cytotype differentiation may contribute to maintenance of species boundaries in sympatry. In the Himalayas, the restriction of buttercups to higher altitudes probably hampers ecological differentiation; hence, ongoing hybridization blurs species boundaries in sympatry. Isolation mechanisms in high mountain systems cannot be generalized but depend on the peculiar geomorphological and climatic conditions. (C) 2015 Geobotanisches Institut ETH, Stiftung Ruebel.

Using mitochondrial control sequences from 242 individuals and single nucleotide polymorphisms from 106 individuals, we examine population structure among geographic and social groups of short-finned pilot whales in the Hawaiian Islands, and test for links between social and genetic structure.

We find genetically driven social structure, or high relatedness among social units and clusters (p<.001), and a positive relationship between relatedness and association between individuals (p<.0001). Further, socially organized clusters are genetically distinct, indicating that social structure drives genetic divergence within the population, likely through restricted mate selection (F(ST)p=.05).

To investigate the individual, social and physical environment correlates of preschool children's compliance with Australian/Canadian and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) screen recommendations. Method. An Ecological Model (EM) was used to identify constructs potentially associated with children's screen time. In 2008-2009, parents in Melbourne, Australia, reported their child's screen time and on a range of potential correlates. Children (n = 935; 54% boys, mean age 4.54 +/- 0.70 years) were assessed as meeting or not meeting each of the screen recommendations. Logistic regression assessed bivariable and multivariable associations. Results. In total, 15 explanatory variables, across the three domains of the EM were associated with boys' and/or girls' compliance with either Australian/Canadian or AAP recommendations. Correlates varied by sex and recommendation. Maternal television viewing time was the only consistent correlate for both boys' and girls' compliance with both recommendations. No demographic groups were identified as being less likely to comply with screen recommendations. Conclusion. Public health programs should take account of the sex-specific nature of correlates of preschool children's screen time. Preschool children across all demographic groups need support to engage in less screen use. Parents may benefit from education and parenting skills to minimize potentially harmful effects of excessive screen time for their child. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Chronic, low-intensity parasite infections can reduce host fitness through negative impacts on reproduction and survival, even if they produce few overt symptoms. As a result, these parasites can influence the evolution of host morphology, behaviour and physiology. The physiological consequences of chronic infection can provide insight into the processes underlying parasite-driven natural selection. 2. Here, we evaluate the physiological consequences of natural, low-intensity infection in an avian host-parasite system: adult male red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) infected with haemosporidian parasites. Chronic haemosporidian infection has previously been shown to reduce both reproductive success and survival in several avian species. 3. We used antimalarial medications to experimentally reduce haemosporidian parasitaemia (the proportion of blood cells infected with haemosporidian parasites) and measured the effect of treatment on body condition, haematology, immune function, physiological stress and oxidative state. 4. Treatment with an antimalarial medication reduced parasitaemia for the most prevalent haemosporidian parasites from the genus Plasmodium. Treatment also increased haemoglobin and haematocrit, and decreased red blood cell production rates. We detected no effect of treatment on body condition, immune metrics, plasma corticosterone concentrations, total antioxidant capacity or reactive oxygen metabolites. 5. Our results suggest that the damage and replacement of red blood cells during infection could be important costs of chronic haemosporidian infection. Strong links between parasitaemia and the physiological consequences of infection indicate that even for relatively low-intensity infections, measuring parasitaemia rather than only presence/absence could be important when evaluating the role of infection in influencing hosts' behaviour, physiology or fitness.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Schoenle, Laura/M-9614-2017; Haussmann, Mark/HPE-2425-2023; Schoenle, Laura/J-7978-2016","Schoenle, Laura/0000-0002-9591-1194; Kernbach, Meredith/0000-0001-8161-057X; Moore, Ignacio/0000-0001-8875-8913",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0021-8790","1365-2656",NA,NA,NA,"NOV",2017,86,"6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1483","1496",NA,"10.1111/1365-2656.12753","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12753",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28884826,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000413406700020","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Objective: To investigate if residential exposure to different types of green space is associated with childhood asthma prevalence in Belgium. Methods: Asthma prevalence was estimated from sales data of reimbursed medication for obstructive airway disease (OAD) prescribed to children between 2010 and 2014, aggregated at census tract level (n = 1872) by sex and age group (6-12 and 13-18 years). Generalized log-linear mixed effects models with repeated measures were used to estimate effects of relative covers of forest, grassland and garden in the census tract of the residence on OAD medication sales. Models were adjusted for air pollution (PM10), housing quality and administrative region. Results: Consistent associations between OAD medication sales and relative covers of grassland and garden were observed (unadjusted parameter estimates per IQR increase of relative cover, range across four strata: grassland, beta = 0.15-0.17; garden, beta = 0.13-0.17). The associations remained significant after adjusting for housing quality and chronic air pollution (adjusted parameter estimates per IQR increase of relative cover, range across four strata: grassland, beta = 0.10-0.14; garden, beta = 0.07-0.09). There was no association between OAD medication sales and forest cover. Conclusions: Based on aggregated data, we found that living in close proximity to areas with high grass cover (grasslands, but also residential gardens) may negatively impact child respiratory health. Potential allergic and non-allergic mechanisms that underlie this association include elevated exposure to grass pollen and fungi and reduced exposure to environmental biodiversity.

Their biological characteristics, including very large size, slow growth, longevity, late age-at-maturity and the tendency to form spawning aggregations makes them particularly vulnerable to overfishing. In Baja California, Mexico, the lack of robust historical catch data and fishery independent estimates of abundance hinders the assessment of temporal trends in population size and the evaluation of grouper population dynamics, as well the development and implementation of adequate management plans. Using an interdisciplinary approach that included (1) the review of non-scientific historical documents, (2) analysis of official catch records, (3) interviews with three generations of fishermen and (4) visual censuses to estimate abundance and the current size distribution, we reconstructed the historical abundance and maximum sizes of six species of Serranids of the genera Epinephelus and Mycteroperca as well as Stereolepis gigas in the Magdalena-Almejas Bay lagoonal complex in northwestern Mexico. Although catch volumes increased by 225% during the last 13 years, fishermen perception indicated a 30% decrease in the estimated maximum size and 57% decrease in the maximum weight captured over the past four decades. Based on insight gained from the four approaches, the general trend suggested an overall decrease in the abundance of some species. However, these changes were not perceived equally by the three generations of interviewed fishers; only older fishermen (>55 years of age) perceived a drastic decrease in population size. It is therefore important to involve young fishers in educational programs to avoid incurring in a shifting baseline syndrome. The limited quantitative data available for the region coupled with a trend toward lower abundance and smaller maximum sizes makes the implementation of specific monitoring and management measures for these species imperative.

Forest transition theory has provided important insights into the 'necessary but not sufficient' conditions for countries shifting from net deforestation to net reforestation. To advance forest transition theory, scholars should recognize forests as complex and dynamic social-ecological systems and use analytical methods that accommodate that complexity. Transdisciplinary research that incorporates a broader range of qualitative and quantitative methods and tools is required. We analyzed the historical, social, and political factors influencing forest transition pathways in Cambodia. Cambodia exhibits similar economic pre-conditions to its neighbors, which have passed through a forest transition, yet deforestation rates remain high with no indication of slowing.

Infection with the fungus, Geomyces destructans, is thought to increase the time bats spend out of torpor during hibernation, leading to starvation. Little is known about hibernation in healthy, free-ranging bats and more data are needed to help predict consequences of WNS. Trade-offs presumably exist between the energetic benefits and physiological/ecological costs of torpor, leading to the prediction that the relative importance of spring energy reserves should affect an individual's use of torpor and depletion of energy reserves during winter. Myotis lucifugus mate during fall and winter but females do not become pregnant until after spring emergence. Thus, female reproductive success depends on spring fat reserves while male reproductive success does not. Consequently, females should be thrifty in their use of fat compared to males. We measured body condition index (BCI; mass/forearm length) of 432 M. lucifugus in Manitoba, Canada during the winter of 2009/2010. Bats were captured during the fall mating period (n = 200), early hibernation (n = 125), and late hibernation (n = 128). Adult females entered hibernation with greater fat reserves and consumed those reserves more slowly than adult males and young of the year.

Mean depth-averaged alongshore velocities increased with distance from shore at all sites. This repeated and consistent 'coastal boundary layer' (CBL) pattern exhibits a logarithmic profile that resembles that associated with the 'law of the wall' of smaller-scale turbulent boundary layers, despite differences in spatial dimension and governing physics. A tentative scaling of dominant terms in an alongshore momentum balance suggests nontrivial levels of lateral stress, but small cross-shore gradients in this quantity. Such a trend of near-constant lateral stress, when combined with simple representations of horizontal mixing (i.e. eddy viscosity parameterizations) that increase approximately linearly with distance from shore, provides a possible explanation for the observed logarithmic velocity pattern. Incorporating these cross-shore gradients in alongshore velocity and cross-shore mixing in a 2-dimensional particle-tracking simulation leads to a decrease in mean alongshore transport of larvae and an increase in the variance in dispersal distance.

In the cruise of the R/V << Ekolog >> (September 6-11, 2019), synchronous integrated hydrological and biogeochemical studies were for the first time performed in the Onezhskiy Bay depending on the phase of a tidal cycle in September. The standard methods applied for this purpose included two sections in the White Sea, namely along the Western Solovetskaya Salma Strait and through the Onezhskiy Bay from north to south. This permitted to determine the chlorophyll a and nutrients contents, the taxonomic composition, abundance and biomass of phytoplankton including its vertical distribution within the photic zone, as well as the qualitative and quantitative composition of zooplankton. Organic forms of nitrogen (0.62-0.83 mg/l) prevailed among the nutrients in the Onezhskiy Bay, the contents of Pmin and Porg were close (on average 9 mu g/l), the concentration of phosphorus mineral forms was predominant in the water bottom layer at the deep-sea stations. In the Western Solovetskaya Salma, the phytoplankton biomass average values during high and low water were 6.75 +/- 1.18 mg C/m3 and 10.25 +/- 11.34 mg C/m3, and in the Onezhskiy Bay - 8.07 +/- 2.43 mg C/m3 and 16.61 +/- 13.54 mg C/m3, respectively.

Site suitability might be expected to increase with spatial isolation after other factors are accounted for, since isolation increases the chance that a site is unoccupied only because of propagule limitation. For two native annual forbs in Californian grasslands, we combined experimental seeding and niche modeling to ask whether suitability of unoccupied sites could be predicted by spatial variables (either distances from, or densities of, conspecific populations), either by themselves or in combination with niche models. We also asked whether experimental tests of these predictions held up not only in the short term (one year), but also in the longer term (three years).

However, the multifarious nature of environmental change, the strength and the relative timing of each stressor largely limit our understanding of biological responses to environmental change. In particular, early response to unpredictable environmental change, critical to survival and fitness in later life stages, is largely uncharacterized. Here, we characterize the early transcriptional response of the keystone species Daphnia magna to twelve environmental perturbations, including biotic and abiotic stressors. We first perform a differential expression analysis aimed at identifying differential regulation of individual genes in response to stress. This preliminary analysis revealed that a few individual genes were responsive to environmental perturbations and they were modulated in a stressor and genotype-specific manner. Given the limited number of differentially regulated genes, we were unable to identify pathways involved in stress response. Hence, to gain a better understanding of the genetic and functional foundation of tolerance to multiple environmental stressors, we leveraged the correlative nature of networks and performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis.

Design: Group randomized controlled trial with 12-month follow-up. Methods: The intervention, guided by Social Cognitive Theory, involved 357 adolescent girls (13.2 +/- 0.5 years) from 12 secondary schools (6 intervention schools, 6 control schools) in low-income communities in the Hunter and Central Coast regions of New South Wales, Australia. The intervention included enhanced school sport, lunchtime physical activity sessions, interactive seminars, student handbooks, nutrition workshops, pedometers, parent newsletters and text messages to encourage physical activity and healthy eating, and a decrease in sedentary behavior. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 12-months and included: physical activity (accelerometers), sedentary behaviors (questionnaire and accelerometers), and social-cognitive mediators of physical activity (questionnaire). Results: There were significant between group differences in favor of the intervention group for self-reported recreational computer use (-26.0 min; 95% CI, -46.9 to -5.1), and sedentary activities summed (-56.4 min; 95% CI, -110.1 to -2.7), however objective sedentary behavior showed no differences. There were no group-by-time effects for any of the physical activity outcomes or hypothesized mediators. Conclusions: A school-based intervention tailored for adolescent girls from schools located in low-income communities significantly reduced time spent in sedentary activities.

Within the Antarctic ecosystem, diatoms, a key group of phytoplankton at the base of the marine food web, play a crucial role in maintaining marine ecosystem balance and functioning. Conventionally, fossil diatom assemblages have been investigated in marine sediment records to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions and understand climate change patterns of Antarctica. Recently, the application of ancient DNA techniques to ocean sediments (sedimentary ancient DNA, sedaDNA) has provided new insights into diatom community responses to environmental change over geological time scales. One benefit of sedaDNA analysis is that this technique can detect fragile diatom species that do not preserve well and are thus difficult to study via traditional microscopy techniques. In this paper, we review the importance of diatoms as indicators of Antarctic paleoenvironmental change, the novel use of diatom sedaDNA to assist Antarctic paleoenvironmental reconstruction, and the challenges and promises of using the sedaDNA approach. We propose that Fragilariopsis cylindrus, an extant polar diatom species, is an ideal model organism to study adaptation patterns of diatoms to changing climate due to its ecological success through time and the availability of whole-genome information for this species.

Biochemical conversion involves hydrolysis and fermentation while thermochemical conversion involves gasification and catalytic synthesis. Even though these routes produce comparable amounts of ethanol and have similar energy efficiency at the plant level, little is known about their relative environmental performance from a life cycle perspective. Especially, the indirect impacts, i.e. emissions and resource consumption associated with the production of various process inputs, are largely neglected in previous studies. This article compiles material and energy flow data from process simulation models to develop life cycle inventory and compares the fossil fuel consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and water consumption of both biomass-to-ethanol production processes. The results are presented in terms of contributions from feedstock, direct, indirect, and co-product credits for four representative biomass feedstocks i.e., wood chips, corn stover, waste paper, and wheat straw. To explore the potentials of the two conversion pathways, different technological scenarios are modeled, including current, 2012 and 2020 technology targets, as well as different production/co-production configurations. The modeling results suggest that biochemical conversion has slightly better performance on greenhouse gas emission and fossil fuel consumption, but that thermochemical conversion has significantly less direct, indirect, and life cycle water consumption. Also, if the thermochemical plant operates as a biorefinery with mixed alcohol co-products separated for chemicals, it has the potential to achieve better performance than biochemical pathway across all environmental impact categories considered due to higher co-product credits associated with chemicals being displaced.

Despite the ecological significance and geographic range of Cocos expansion, large-scale assessments of coconut proliferation are still lacking due to the isolated nature of many islands where Cocos is found.

This case study evaluates the effectiveness of applying grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural features to very high resolution (0.5-2 m) WorldView-2 imagery to resolve the canopy heterogeneity problem and map the extent of Cocos spread on 21 islets of Palmyra Atoll, a protected United States National Wildlife Refuge in the Northern Line Islands. A random forest (RF)-driven classification scheme differentiating between coconut palms, native trees including Pisonia grandis, and endemic Scaevola sericea shrubs achieved 97.0% overall accuracy and 98.4% producer's and user's accuracies for the coconut palm class when trained on a combined spectral and GLCM textural feature set. Classifications restricted to the eight spectral bands of WorldView-2 are not only less accurate (89.4% overall accuracy), but also significantly worse at identifying Cocos canopies (79.0% versus 98.0% accuracy when GLCM textures are included). However, paring down the full set of sixteen spectral and textural features to the three most important of each type did not result in significant changes in accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a joint high-resolution textural and spectral approach for remotely quantifying the spread of Cocos and its impacts on native tree communities throughout the tropics, including remote island locations.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"De Leo, Giulio/AAC-5098-2019","De Leo, Giulio/0000-0002-4186-3369; Burnett, Michael/0000-0001-5126-5568; Micheli, Fiorenza/0000-0002-6865-1438",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0143-1161","1366-5901",NA,NA,NA,"OCT 2",2019,40,"19",NA,NA,"SI",NA,"7329","7355",NA,"10.1080/01431161.2019.1594440","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2019.1594440",NA,"MAR 2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000465762800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Our findings show that while the establishment of hilsa sanctuary areas has enhanced the previously low ecological sustainability of local small-scale fishing, the management of this program has challenged the social resilience of hilsa fishers by creating new inequalities in the distribution of power and privilege, in terms of the ways in which seasonal fishing bans are enforced and compensation for income loss during the ban periods is distributed. Based on our findings, we suggest specific measures for strengthening social resilience at the local level, including building community networks, developing community infrastructures, updating existing rules and regulations, providing alternative means of generating income for fishers during the crisis periods (e.g. natural disasters and fishing ban periods) and more active sharing of responsibility between stakeholders and government for management of the hilsa fishery.

Birds flying at night are known to aggregate around artificial light and collide with illuminated objects, which may result from attraction and/or disorientation. In other contexts, birds are repelled by light-based deterrents, including lasers and spotlights. Artificial light can also change birds' perceptions of habitat quality, resulting in selection or avoidance of illuminated areas. Studies documenting aggregation, deterrence, and habitat selection are typically considered separate literature bodies, but they actually study a common set of populations, interventions/exposures, and responses. Our systematic map provides a comprehensive, searchable database of evidence of the effects of artificial light on bird movement and distribution, increasing both the quantity and diversity of studies that are accessible for further comparison and synthesis. We identify and describe the evidence available for four secondary questions relevant to conservation or management: aggregation/mortality at structures with artificial lights, evidence that light attracts and/or disorients birds, light-based deterrent efficacy, and the influence of continuous illumination on habitat selection. Methods: Using the principles of systematic reviews and methods published in an earlier protocol, we conducted an extensive and interdisciplinary literature search. We searched multidisciplinary citation indices as well as databases and websites specific to conservation, pest management, transportation, and energy. In our map, we included all studies reporting eligible populations (birds), interventions/exposures (artificial light), and outcomes (movement through space, behaviour preceding movement, or distribution). We evaluated the quantity of available evidence based on meta-data fields related to study context, population traits, light source characteristics, and outcome variables. We used these meta-data to identify relevant evidence for each secondary question and describe aspects of our secondary questions that may support reviews (evidence clusters) and others that require more research (knowledge gaps). Review findings: We manually screened 26,208 articles and coded meta-data for 490 eligible studies in a searchable database, organizing the literature to facilitate future reviews and evidence-based management. Much of the evidence was concentrated in particular locations (Northern hemisphere), taxonomic orders (Passeriformes, Charadrii-formes, and others), and light wavelengths (red and white). We identified 56 distinct response variables and organized them into 3 categories (behaviour, distribution, and avian community), showing the diversity in bird responses to light. Conclusions: Our database can be used to answer the secondary questions we identified and other questions about the effects of artificial light on bird movement and resulting changes to distribution. There may be sufficient evidence for a review of the weather and lunar conditions associated with collisions, which could help identify nights when reduction of artificial light is most important. Further experiments should investigate whether specific types of light can reduce collisions by increasing the detectability of structures with artificial lights. The efficacy of lasers as deterrents could be evaluated through systematic review, though more studies are needed for UV/violet lasers. To reduce the impacts of outdoor lighting on birds, research should investigate how spectral composition of white light influences bird attraction, orientation, and habitat selection.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Adams, Caroline/ABE-6358-2020; Bayne, Erin/IUP-1777-2023; St. Clair, Colleen/A-2953-2016","Adams, Carrie Ann/0000-0001-7381-0555",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2047-2382",NA,NA,NA,"DEC 15",2021,10,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"37","10.1186/s13750-021-00246-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-021-00246-8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000730237500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We determined plant density and analysed the genetic diversity, differentiation and small-scale genetic structure using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. The breeding system of V chamaedrys turned out as self-incompatible and outcrossing. Its genetic diversity did not differ among land-use types. This may be attributed to large population sizes and the strong dispersal ability of the species, which maintains genetically diverse populations not prone to genetic drift. Genetic differentiation among populations was low (overall F-ST = 0.075) but significant among the three regions. Land use had only weak effects on population differentiation in only one region.

Eel abundance (catch per unit effort, CPUE) was assessed for all eels and by size class for small (total length < 300 mm), intermediate (>= 300 to <450 mm), and large (>= 450 mm) eels. The environmental characteristics of the French estuaries were described by twelve descriptor variables, mainly related to hydro-morphological and sedimentary factors. Based on principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis, estuary size was identified as the main explanatory variable and used to compare eel abundance. Eel abundance differed significantly according to estuary size, with higher abundances observed in small estuaries (7.22 to 13.00 ind. fyke nets 24 h(-1)) compared to large estuaries (0.13 to 0.71 ind. fyke nets 24 h(-1)). Spatial variation in eel abundance was correlated with differences in estuary size for all eel size classes. The influence of anthropogenic pressures on eel abundance was assessed by nine anthropogenic estuarine pressure indicators.

A common garden study revealed significant genetic differentiation in response to land-use intensification within all of the investigated species. Among the studied land-use processes, mowing appeared to have the strongest effect on the differentiation of plant phenotypes, with flowering phenology as the most responsive trait. However, there was substantial variation among species in the magnitude, sometimes also the direction of the observed population differentiation. 4. Synthesis.

We hypothesized that increasing Sarcothelia sp. abundance would be related to species richness decreases and native community structure changes. Multivariate analysis showed significant dissimilarity between invaded (high Sarcothelia sp. abundance) and non-invaded areas (high abundance of the octocoral Neospongodes atlantica and zoantharians). The invaded area showed less species composition variability (i.e., homogenization) than non-invaded ones. Within the invaded area we observed that Sarcothelia sp. abundance reduced species richness. The lowest native benthic richness (10 taxa) was observed in a transect with the highest invader cover, while the transect with the lowest Sarcothelia sp. cover presented 26 native taxa. These findings are likely related to the invasive novel functional traits, i.e., invader growth form and allelochemicals. A clear inverse abundance pattern between invasive Sarcothelia sp. and N. atlantica, indicated an intense competition between octocorals.

Because of similarity and variable morphology across these species, their taxonomy is a source of confusion. Based on integrative taxonomy, including morphological (qualitative and quantitative), ecological, and molecular data, we aimed to diagnose the species from the Soconusco region. We carried out extensive field sampling, collecting 225 individuals from a total of 12 populations, and reviewed one hundred herbarium specimens to evaluate whether the species are diagnosable. We carried out morphometric analyses at the population level on vegetative and reproductive characters and present the first analyses of phenotypic variability of pollen and ovulate strobili in neotropical cycads. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of climatic factors on morphological variation. Morphological characters of ovulate strobili were correlated with climatic conditions. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the morphology of pollen strobili and the environment. In the pollen strobili, we found fixed characters that allow for the identification of the species. The haplotype networks displayed several groups of related haplotypes, which in some species corresponded to mixed population clusters. We detected a discordance between phenotypic and genetic evidence. The integration of evidence offers grounded views for clarifying species boundaries and outlining the differences among species, which we incorporated into a taxonomic key.

The inter-and transdisciplinary character of sustainability research, as well as its change-oriented agenda, require scholars to reflect on their role as researchers, their research focus and methodology, and its relation to academia and society. Using focus groups with 15 researchers at different stages in their academic career, we investigate three forms of reflexivity, i.e., personal, functional, and disciplinary, for sustainability researchers connected to the LUCID (Lund University Centre of Excellence for the Integration of the Social and Natural Dimensions of Sustainability) program experience. We further study similarities and differences in how the researchers experience reflexivity connected to interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches. We find that sustainability researchers experience all three forms of reflexivity. In particular, they are highly reflexive about how research on sustainability issues is dependent on theoretical pluralism; how research can contribute to the transformation of society; and how they, as inter-and transdisciplinary researchers, can construct a space for themselves within the academic system. We also find that transdisciplinary approaches make scholars add a layer of reflexivity to the three categories studied, concerning collaboration beyond academia. Finally, we find that reflexivity about these issues seems to be crucial for how sustainability researchers construct a space for themselves within the academic system. PhD graduates from the LUCID program are deeply reflexive about the function of academic boundaries. It is this awareness that enables them to construct an academic identity entirely beyond boundaries.

According to the socio-ecological model for a territorial, polygamous species, females should be distributed across space and time by habitat resources and predation risks, whereas males should space themselves according to the degree of female aggregation and reproductive synchrony. To investigate how females affect the male-male transmission paradigm of Bayou virus, rodents were captured, marked, released, and re-captured in two macrohabitat types across a 30-month period. Microhabitat cover variables were quantified around the individual trap stations. A geodatabase was created from habitat and rodent capture data and analysed in a geographical information system. The ratio of breeding to non-breeding females was similar to 1:1, with breeding females overly dispersed and non-breeding females randomly dispersed. Spatial analyses revealed both macro-and microhabitat preferences in females. Compared to sero-negatives, higher proportions of seropositive adult males were found consistently within closer proximities to breeding females but not to non-breeding females, indicating that male locations were not driven simply by habitat selection. Activities to acquire dispersed receptive females could be an important driver of Bayou virus transmission among male hosts.

Design/methodology/approach - A model has been developed for assessing sustainability learning outcomes due to the incorporation of the concept of industrial ecology into undergraduate and postgraduate engineering programs. This model assesses how the Engineering Faculty at Curtin University has included a core engineering unit (Engineering for Sustainable Development) and four postgraduate units (Cleaner Production Tools, Eco-efficiency, Industrial Ecology and Sustainable Technology) in its undergraduate and postgraduate engineering program, to enable modern engineering education to reflect the benefits of industrial ecology in the implementation of sustainable engineering solutions and decision-making processes. Using this model, this paper demonstrates how the syllabus, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary assignment tasks, lectures and tutorials have been developed since 2006 in order to develop the concept of industrial ecology in undergraduate and postgraduate engineering education. The paper has also analysed the different teaching methods that have been applied since 2006 to generate increased student satisfaction in these new and challenging subjects. Findings - The university environment can temper the potential outcomes from increasing the sustainability content in engineering education, given the general lack of student maturity in understanding the value of sustainability objectives together with course limitations on sustainability content and the arduous and lengthy processes involved in changing course curricula. Research limitations/implications - Since the Engineering for Sustainable Development unit has been introduced only recently, it was beyond the scope of the research to interview graduate engineers who completed this unit to investigate how they have applied the concept of industrial ecology to achieve sustainability outcomes in their workplaces.

Obstacles occur in every major aspect of academia - including structure, communication, reward systems, research, curriculum, and evaluation. We assess the development of programmes that integrate sustainable development with biological conservation at 36 leading US universities that are participating in an initially $2 millions initiative. Examination of the universities' planning and implementation grants, the results of a written questionnaire for programme directors, and informal oral interviews with participants, reveal how academia is responding to the challenge through the development of new cross-disciplinary courses, minor and certificate programmes, and master's- and doctoral-level degrees. Half of the programmes overcame obstacles associated with the departmental structure of universities by being housed in already-established cross-disciplinary institutions, centres, graduate schools, or programmes. The universities, in total, identified faculty teaching members from 35 disciplines to be involved in their conservation/development programmes. The major disciplines represented were geography, biology, agricultural science, forestry, wildlife, anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology. The natural scientists outnumbered the social scientists by almost two to one (182/101) in the planning phase of programme development, and remained even more disproportionate in the implementation phase (205/108).

These included: (a) synthesis of relevant components from many disciplines to create a distinct interdisciplinary unit; (b) infusion of pertinent materials into the context of disciplinary courses; (c) establishment of multidisciplinary overview courses; (d) augmentation of training of specialists in existing disciplines to faciliate communication with other fields, using field-courses, internships, case-studies, and cross-disciplinary research projects; and (e) training of generalists.

In this review, we obtained relevant studies on lake sediment records by searching the key word 'age-depth' from the following databases: Web of Science and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, the largest Chinese academic database). We analyzed the literature based on its type (published in a Chinese/English journal or as a Master's/PhD thesis), period of publication, journal (if published in a journal), key authors, study area, dating scale, and main aims.

Interdisciplinary work is required to fully understand the complexity of marine MPs (MMP) and to address the potential stress that this form of pollution may put on marine ecosystems. This study introduces an approach called information flow analysis (IFA), which intends to connect different fields of study through data flows, demonstrating the importance of these fields in the development of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) of MMPs. The IFA approach was used to clarify where microplastic data is expected to come from with the goal of providing insight into how to obtain the data required for risk assessment (RA) and life cycle assessment (LCA). In order to observe and demonstrate these links, the next step was to develop a site-specific coarse material flow analysis (MFA) based on previously estimated MP emissions from Norway and data from MP sampling in the inner Oslofjord. The coarse MFA demonstrated that MP sources in Norway were estimated to contribute between 85% and 96% rubbery MP particles and between 4% and 15% semisynthetic MP particles in 2018, while blue mussels sampled by the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) contained 93% rubbery MP particles and 7% semisynthetic MP particles.

However, there is a contradiction between the need to implement this very popular in the West interdisciplinary approach into the educational process at university and the low awareness of the academic community of Russia about all pros and cons of this pedagogical innovation. The prime feature of this approach in education is its power to facilitate learning outcomes of university students through building links and conceptual connections between various ideas and facts across different disciplines. Learning and teaching in the interdisciplinary paradigm allows fast and efficient transition of skills and knowledge gained in one discipline to another. In addition, it enhances learning and hands-on experiences, develops collaboration and cooperation, encourages students' critical thinking and problem solving skills, thereby preparing them for life and professional career. An interdisciplinary approach is the basic concept of our research.

Unfortunately, social-ecological systems (SES) theory, sustainability evaluation frameworks, and assessment methods are still foreign not only to farmers but to many researchers, students, NGOs, policy makers/operators, and other interested groups. In this paper we examine the main achievements and challenges of the MESMIS Program (Spanish acronym for Indicator-based Sustainability Assessment Framework), a 15-year ongoing effort with impact in 60 case studies and 20 undergraduate and graduate programs mainly in Ibero-America that is attempting to cope with the stated challenges. The MESMIS experience shows that it is possible to conduct sustainability assessments in the context of small farmers through a long-term, participatory, interdisciplinary, and multi-institutional approach that integrates a solid theoretical background, a field-tested operational framework, learning tools specifically devised to facilitate the understanding of sustainability as a multidimensional and dynamic concept, and a growing set of case studies to apply to and get feedback from users. Specifically, through the dissemination of the MESMIS assessment framework in a large set of case studies in a contrasting set of social-ecological contexts, we have been able to: (a) characterize the NRMS, their subsystems, and their main interactions; (b) link attributes, i.e., general systemic properties, with sustainability indicators to assess critical socioeconomic and environmental aspects of the NRMS; (c) integrate indicators through multicriteria tools and to expose the multidimensional aspects of sustainability; (d) propose an initial multiscale assessment to articulate processes and actors at different spatial scales; (e) develop multimedia learning tools, i.e., Interactive-MESMIS, to help users understand dynamic concepts, trade-offs, and counter-intuitive behavior; and (f) promote participatory processes through role-playing games and agent-based simulation models.

Here we review trends in research effort over three decades (1985-2016) through content analysis of every abstract (n = 2,701) presented at the annual conference of the American Elasmobranch Society (AES), the oldest and largest professional society focused on the scientific study and management of these fishes. The most common research areas of AES abstracts were reproductive biology, movement/telemetry, age and growth, population genetics, and diet/feeding ecology, with different areas of focus for different study species or families. The most commonly studied species were large and charismatic (e.g., White Shark, Carcharodon carcharias), easily accessible to long-term established field research programs (e.g., Lemon Shark, Negaprion brevirostris, and Sandbar Shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus), or easily kept in aquaria for lab-based research (e.g., Bonnethead Shark, Sphyrna tiburo). Nearly 90% of all described chondrichthyan species have never been mentioned in an AES abstract, including some of the most threatened species in the Americas. The proportion of female* first authors has increased over time, though many current female* Society members are graduate students. Nearly half of all research presented at AES occurred in the waters of the United States rather than in the waters of developing nations where there are more threatened species and few resources for research or management.

Such misalignments can undermine the effectiveness of conservation efforts to motivate pro-conservation behavior. In Samburu, Kenya, an area with multiple active international conservation programs, we sought to assess local residents' perspectives regarding three factors known to influence pro-environmental behavior: (a) ecological knowledge, including views on wildlife abundance and extinction risk; (b) perceptions of agency regarding wildlife conservation (here defined as the ability of humans to influence wildlife populations); and (c) personal motivations for wildlife conservation. We interviewed 74 residents and evaluated whether their perspectives aligned with the premises and assumptions that underpin the strategies commonly used by international organizations to promote wildlife conservation in the area. We found that concepts of rarity and extinction based on Western-based science were not salient in how residents thought about local wildlife populations. Consistent with core assumptions of Western conservation programs, however, most residents did feel a sense of agency to influence wildlife populations, and reported economic incentives as primary motivations for conservation.

In all three levels theoretical education and practical skills in the training and qualification of social workers are focusing on sustainability, ecology, environment and ecosystemic theory, including the conceptualization of personal welfare and human rights. Social work establishes a strong link with the environment and sustainable development, as a profession and as an academic discipline. Bringing ecological issues and concerns into the vison of students and professionals gives the opportunity, to promote a network of studies, systematize recommendations, and develop theoretical and scientific frames to support the practice. Thinking about challenges and opportunities of this century, social work as a profession needs to respond to current social issues such as a European social model under debate; a new paradigm of society identified with social citizenship; a cultural and ethnic diversity with challenges posed in the field of democracy and citizenship; globalization and the impact on the social well-being and quality of life; promotion of International Social Work; new and more complex social needs; evolution of new technologies and the information society. This study is essentially descriptive in nature though it has both quantitative and qualitative elements (mix methods). The focus of the Ecosocial Model on human rights, social justice and ethical values creates a solid foundation to reinforce the social work curricula. Therefore, Social Work education has an important role in bringing ecological issues and concerns into the vision of students and professionals. The practice along with research, in this area, gives also the opportunity to reflect, innovate and promote a global responsible citizenship. The results show that in social work practice, applying an ecological approach can be best understood as looking at persons, families, cultures, communities, and policies and to identify and intervene upon strengths and weaknesses in the transactional processes between these systems to generate transformation in social and human development, leading to an effective and sustainable change. Furthermore, it is an opportunity for aligning theoretical knowledge and learning, with the needs of society and the market place.

The majority of humanity is concentrated in coastal communities: approximately half of the world's population lives within 200 km of a coast. In many developing countries, raw wastewater is discharged into coastal waters without being treated, in the belief that these discharges do not significantly affect the environment. In reality, these contaminants not only threaten human health, but also often contribute to the loss of marine animals which local peoples often rely on for food and income. In the future, continuing population growth and economic development will increase the demand for water and the severity of pollution. There is a clear and overwhelming need for sanitation and water purification in developing coastal communities, but it is not afforded by conventional, energy-intensive and chemically-intensive water treatment or fossil-fuel-based energy systems. In high-poverty equatorial coasts, the stable temperatures, steady winds, and predictable solar input greatly facilitate sustainable practices for water treatment and energy production.

In this program, senior-level engineering courses train undergraduate and graduate students to design and deploy ecologically-designed wastewater treatment plants with renewable energy systems in collaboration with faculty-led research teams and community participants. These courses are strategically designed to be training and recruitment tools to help prepare the local student chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB) for the project, and to provide students at all levels with challenging, immersive, hand-on experiences that augment their research and education in sustainability. This work is significant because it is one of the first international, multi-disciplinary programs in Sustainable Engineering in North America, and utilizes a student outreach organization (EWB) to mobilize the resulting efforts to engage developing coastal communities with the assistance of practicing engineers. The longevity of this program is supported through cross-disciplinary research, course development, and mentoring of EWB projects containing interdisciplinary, multi-component systems. Future partnerships in the areas of wind energy, coral reef resilience, food systems science, economic development, and eco-tourism are planned to further enhance the program.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2199-7373",NA,"978-3-319-32933-8; 978-3-319-32932-1",NA,NA,NA,2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"15","21",NA,"10.1007/978-3-319-32933-8_2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-32933-8_2","10.1007/978-3-319-32933-8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000389523500003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In today's knowledge society, the amount of scientific-applied information, which university graduates have to acquire, continues to increase continuously. There is a concurrent reduction in the number of study hours to undertake educational programmes in order to increase the hours for students' independent work. Against this background, higher school is required to increase future experts' competencies. Therefore, the content of fundamental and special disciplines of entire period of training and independent work of students should be thoroughly coordinated by increasing students' motivation to self-education and self-development. Classroom-based and independent learning of disciplines and sections of fundamental academic courses, especially chemistry, is impossible without formation of students' scientific thinking. Today, it is difficult to consider the activity of most professionals without the ability to think scientifically: active expansion of science into professional sphere has a strong tendency to be increased. The aim of the present research is to show the possibilities of formation and development of scientific thinking in the students of natural-scientific and technical directions of education using the example of studying of one of the elements of programmes in chemistry (the method of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis). Methodology and research methods. The research was carried out on the basis of competency-based, systematic and interdisciplinary approaches. The methods of analysis, synthesis, integration, differentiation and compactification of fundamental knowledge and training material were used. Results and scientific novelty. The high potential of chemical education for formation of scientific thinking, subject content (chemical), natural-scientific and holistic scientific thinking is emphasised. However, chemistry education in higher education institution is complicated by the absence of the unified structure of fundamental preparation, the preservation of extensive approach to the content of chemical disciplines, the irrational organisation of students' independent work, which now is accounted for a half of instructional time. Overcoming these problems lies in the dialectic unity of fundamental and practice-oriented knowledge, which is provided by the compliance with the principles of continuity and interdisciplinarity. It is necessary to provide deductive structurisation of training material in order to give integrity and systemacity to the content of education, without which it is impossible to create a comprehensive natural-scientific picture of the world in students. The key initial element of vocational training stimulating the formation of reflexive skills and scientific thinking of future experts is mastering by students of a categorical-conceptual framework of science, which is consistently and comprehensively revealed throughout a high school stage of education. The authors designated phases of development of scientific thinking (formal-logical, reflexive-theoretical, hypothetico-deductive thinking), which are not clearly differentiated due to interpenetration and entanglement of their components and identity of thought processes in terms of their speed and quality. However, the allocation of these stages allows to structure and to correct the content of educational material taking into account the characteristics and the level of students' readiness. From these standpoints, the expediency of more detailed examination of the NMR method is proved within the disciplines such as Chemistry, General Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry and Analytical Chemistry (a part of material about the NMR method can be worked out by students independently). This method, based on one phenomenon, includes hundreds of various types of the experiments, which are intended for receiving particular information. The NMR method is widely used both in scientific research, including master's thesis, and in the most various manufacturing spheres. Today, the spectroscopy of NMR is recognised as the most powerful informative and perspective method of structural analysis of substance. The fundamental nature, interdisciplinarity and universality of the method provide students with basic professional knowledge on physics, chemistry, medicine, biology, technology and ecology. The authors of the present research propose the option of configuration of educational information on NMR. According to the suggested version, the principle of work is the following: firstly, bachelors study the system of key concepts and terms, moving gradually from formal-logical to substantial generalisations; then, students learn to explain the phenomena scientifically and to make forecasts, and, as a result, they become the owners of hypothetico-deductive thinking. The acquired competencies are the key to professional literacy, which is improved in master's degree programme, when the previously compactified scientific knowledge in a contracted form is developed in the form suitable for an optimal solution of a particular research or practical aim. The similar scheme of vocational training makes it possible to overcome traditional orientation of high school programmes of the natural-science block (i.e. retention of permanently growing amount of factual material). Practical significance. The research materials can be useful for methodologists of the higher school, for experts engaged in methodological development and the organisation of educational process, for high school teachers of chemistry and related disciplines, for post-graduate students and master's students of chemical and chemico-technological specialties as well.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1994-5639","2310-5828",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2019,21,"8",NA,NA,NA,NA,"29","64",NA,"10.17853/1994-5639-2019-8-29-64","http://dx.doi.org/10.17853/1994-5639-2019-8-29-64",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000497662400002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A better understanding of the underlying drivers and distributional effects of these changes requires integration of social and ecological approaches that often have different epistemological origins. Resilience thinking has gained increased traction in social-ecological systems research because it provides a dynamic analysis of the cross-scalar interactions between multiple conditions and processes. However, the system-oriented perspective inherent in resilience thinking fails to acknowledge the heterogeneous values, interests, and power of social actors and their roles in navigating social-ecological change. Incorporation of political ecology and well-being perspectives can provide an actor-oriented analysis of the trade-offs associated with change and help to determine which state is desirable for whom. However, empirical demonstrations of such interdisciplinary approaches remain scarce. Here, we explore the combined application of resilience, political ecology, and well-being in investigating the root causes of social-ecological change and identifying the winners and losers of system transformation through empirical analysis of the differential changes in farming systems in two villages in coastal Bangladesh. Using the adaptive cycle as a structuring model, we examine the evolution of the shrimp aquaculture system over the past few decades, particularly looking at the power dynamics between households of different wealth classes. We found that although asymmetric land ownership and political ties enabled the wealthier households to reach their desired farming system in one village, social resilience achieved through memory, leadership, and crisis empowered poorer households to exercise their agency in another village.

Our approach embraced a holistic consideration of the social-ecological land systems, gathering a dataset of 26 variables spanning across 7 dimensions: physical, biological, land cover, economic, demographic, political, and cultural. We identified 13 SELS nested in 5 larger social-ecological regions (SER). Each SELS was discussed and described by specific groups of specialists. Although 4 environmental and 1 socioeconomic variable explained most of the distribution of the coarse SER classification, a diversity of 15 other variables were shown to be essential for defining several SELS, highlighting specific features that differentiate them.

Behaviour is the interface between an organism and its environment, and behavioural plasticity is important for organisms to cope with environmental change. Social behaviour is particularly important because sociality is a dynamic process, where environmental variation influences group dynamics and social plasticity can mediate resource acquisition. Heterogeneity in the ecological environment can therefore influence the social environment. The combination of the ecological and social environments may be interpreted collectively as the socioecological environment, which could explain variation in fitness. 2. Our objective was to outline a framework through which individual social and spatial phenotypes can be integrated and interpreted as phenotypes that covary as a function of changes in the socioecological environment. We propose the socioecological environment is composed of individual behavioural traits, including sociality and habitat selection, both of which are repeatable, potentially heritable and may reflect animal personality traits. We also highlight how ecological and social niche theory can be applied to the socioecological environment framework, where individuals occupy different socioecological niches. Individual sociality and habitat selection are also density-dependent, and theory predicts that density-dependent traits should affect reproduction, survival, and therefore fitness and population dynamics. 3. We then illustrate the proximate links between sociality, habitat selection and fitness as well as the ultimate, and possibly adaptive, consequences associated with changes in population density. The ecological, evolutionary and applied implications of our proposed socioecological environment framework are broad and changes in density could influence individual fitness and population dynamics. For instance, human-induced environmental changes can influence population density, which can affect the distribution of social and spatial phenotypes within a population. In summary, we outline a conceptual framework that incorporates individual social and spatial behavioural traits with fitness and we highlight a range of ecological and evolutionary processes that are likely associated with the socioecological environment.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0021-8790","1365-2656",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2018,87,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"113","127",NA,"10.1111/1365-2656.12773","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12773",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29055050,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000417935100012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Working lands are inherently costly to set aside for biodiversity, making the establishment of additional permanent reserves that facilitate connectivity challenging. Yet, even temporary increases in connectivity may enable increased gene flow with long-term benefits for species health and persistence. Objectives Here we explore the potential for dynamic conservation reserves, in the form of either temporarily or semi-permanently fallowed croplands, to increase connectivity in intensive agricultural regions. Methods We evaluate the potential for fallowed lands to facilitate functional habitat connectivity for an at-risk species in the San Joaquin Valley, an intensive agricultural landscape in California, USA. We perform landscape connectivity analyses to examine how drought-induced fallowing between 2011 and 2017 may have impacted connectivity within Kern County for the endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica). Results We found that an increase in fallowed lands from 2011 to 2015/2017 in Kern County likely corresponded to increased functional connectivity for the kit fox, including significant decreases in cumulative cost to distance traveled (-0.8 to 18% and 0.3 to 12.2% in 2015/2017 respective to 2011 across different model scenarios). These significant reductions indicate that cumulative energy costs incurred by kit foxes traveling between core habitats likely decreased with an increase in fallowing, with the estimated benefits from semi-permanently fallowed lands on average 2.4 times greater than for more temporarily fallowed lands. Conclusions Our results highlight that opportunistic and dynamic conservation actions have the potential to reduce conflict between biodiversity preservation and agricultural production in working landscapes by increasing landscape connectivity via temporarily or semi-permanently fallowed parcels.

The findings show that the social-ecological system in the Bangladesh delta may move beyond a safe operating space when a withdrawal of a 50% subsidy for agriculture is combined with the effects of a 2 degrees C temperature increase and sea level rise. Further reductions in upstream river discharge in the Ganges would push the system towards a dangerous zone once a 3.5 degrees C temperature increase was reached.

In Ecology and Conservation, scientific evidence has been seldom used directly to support decision-making, despite calls for an increasing role of ecological science in developing solutions for a sustainable future. To date, multiple causes of the science-practice gap and diverse approaches to link science and practice in Ecology and Conservation have been proposed. To foster a transparent debate and broaden our understanding of the difficulties of using scientific knowledge, we reviewed the perceived causes of the science-practice gap, aiming to: (i) identify the perspectives of ecologists and conservation scientists on this problem, (ii) evaluate the predominance of these perspectives over time and across journals, and (iii) assess them in light of disciplines studying the role of science in decision-making. We based our review on 1563 sentences describing causes of the science-practice gap extracted from 122 articles and on discussions with eight scientists on how to classify these sentences. The resulting process-based framework describes three distinct perspectives on the relevant processes, knowledge and actors in the science-practice interface. The most common perspective assumes only scientific knowledge should support practice, perceiving a one-way knowledge flow from science to practice and recognizing flaws in knowledge generation, communication, and/or use. The second assumes that both scientists and decision-makers should contribute to support practice, perceiving a two-way knowledge flow between science and practice through joint knowledge-production/integration processes, which, for several reasons, are perceived to occur infrequently. The last perspective was very rare, and assumes scientists should put their results into practice, but they rarely do. Some causes (e.g. cultural differences between scientists and decision-makers) are shared with other disciplines, while others seem specific to Ecology and Conservation (e.g. inadequate research scales). All identified causes require one of three general types of solutions, depending on whether the causal factor can (e.g. inadequate research questions) or cannot (e.g. scientific uncertainty) be changed, or if misconceptions (e.g. undervaluing abstract knowledge) should be solved. The unchanged predominance of the one-way perspective over time may be associated with the prestige of evidence-based conservation and suggests that debates in Ecology and Conservation lag behind trends in other disciplines towards bidirectional views ascribing larger roles to decision-makers. In turn, the two-way perspective seems primarily restricted to research traditions historically isolated from mainstream conservation biology. All perspectives represented superficial views of decision-making by not accounting for limits to human rationality, complexity of decision-making contexts, fuzzy science-practice boundaries, ambiguity brought about by science, and different types of knowledge use. However, joint knowledge-production processes from the two-way perspective can potentially allow for democratic decision-making processes, explicit discussions of values and multiple types of science use. To broaden our understanding of the interface and foster productive science-practice linkages, we argue for dialogue among different research traditions within Ecology and Conservation, joint knowledge-production processes between scientists and decision-makers and interdisciplinarity across Ecology, Conservation and Political Science in both research and education.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bertuol-Garcia, Diana/ABG-3635-2021; Morsello, Carla/D-7393-2012; El-Hani, Charbel/Q-1364-2019; Pardini, Renata/C-4095-2012","Pardini, Renata/0000-0002-3769-8401; Bertuol-Garcia, Diana/0000-0002-8248-6192; El-Hani, Charbel/0000-0002-2308-3983; Morsello, Carla/0000-0001-7548-6541",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1464-7931","1469-185X",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2018,93,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1032","1055",NA,"10.1111/brv.12385","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12385",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29160024,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000429699100017","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Here, we provide a brief overview of the scale mismatch literature and discuss potential opportunities to address scale mismatches in drinking water management. We present a case study of spring water management in rural communities in the Cartago province of Costa Rica, where community groups face issues of both spatial and temporal mismatch in providing drinking water to their users. Through this case study, we observed that issues of scale mismatch are often overlooked because of a lack of understanding of the scale at which resources are sustained. We argue that highlighting examples of scale mismatch will help others to identify and understand their own systems and be better prepared to reconfigure operations to govern and manage social-ecological systems.

However, the BEVs are facing the limited cruising range which generally reduces their share in the automotive market. Velocity profile, acceleration characteristics, road gradients, and drive techniques around curves have significant impacts on the energy consumption of the BEVs. A semi-autonomous ecological driver assistance system to regulate the velocity with energy-efficient techniques is proposed to address the limitation. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a real-time nonlinear model predictive controller with improved inequality constraints handling and economic penalty function to plan the online cost-effective cruising velocity. This system is based on the extended cruise control driver assistance system which controls the longitudinal velocity of the BEV in a safe and energy efficient manner by taking advantage of road slopes, effective drive around curves, and respecting the traffic regulation. A real-time optimisation algorithm is adapted and extended with economic objective function. Instead of the conventional Euclidean norms, deadzone penalty functions are proposed to achieve the economic objectives. In addition, the states inequality constraints are handled based on the proposed soft nonlinear complementarity function aimed to preserve the relaxed complementary slackness to enhance the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) method. Obtained numerical simulation and field experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for a semi-autonomous electric vehicle in terms of real-time energy-efficient velocity regulation and constraints satisfaction intended to improve the cruising range capability of the BEVs.

We propose an interdisciplinary approach for analyzing changes in cultural ecosystem services in restored marine ecosystems, based on the DAPSI(W)R(M) framework and following a social-ecological system approach. Our methodology considers environmental, social and economic elements that may be contributing to changes in the provision and demand for cultural ecosystem services in restored ecosystems. Our approach was tested in the Nerbioi estuary, a system that, after the implementation of a wastewater treatment plant at the end of the 20th Century, changed from being one of the most polluted estuaries in Europe to a nearly recovered system. Based on previous studies that have analyzed partial components of the restoration process and of the recreational ecosystem services, here we provide an interdisciplinary picture of the changes occurred in the last 25 years, directly linking the management measures adopted to an increase in human well-being. In the applied methodology, the three discipline domains (social, economic, and environmental) transcend each other to provide a new holistic view, completely different from what one would expect from the addition of the parts.

Characterization and effects of sediments on marine biota now require a multidisciplinary approach, which includes chemical and ecotoxicological analyses and molecular biomarkers. Here, a gene expression study was performed to measure the response of adult females of the Mediterranean copepod Acartia clausi to elutriates of polluted sediments (containing high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs, and heavy metals) from an industrial area in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Bagnoli-Coroglio). Functional annotation of the A. clausi transcriptome generated as reference here, showed a good quality of the assembly and great homology with other copepod and crustacean sequences in public databases. This is one of the few available transcriptomic resources for this widespread copepod species of great ecological relevance in temperate coastal areas. Differential expression analysis between females exposed to the elutriate and those in control seawater identified 1000 differentially expressed genes, of which 743 up- and 257 down-regulated. Within the up-regulated genes, the most represented functions were related to proteolysis (lysosomal protease, peptidase, cathepsin), response to stress and detoxification (heat-shock protein, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, cytochrome P450), and cytoskeleton structure (alpha- and beta-tubulin). Down-regulated genes were mostly involved with ribosome structure (ribosomal proteins) and DNA binding (histone proteins, transcription factors). Overall, these results suggest that processes such as transcription, translation, protein degradation, metabolism of biomolecules, reproduction, and xenobiotic detoxification were altered in the copepod in response to polluted elutriates. In conclusion, our results contribute to gaining information on the transcriptomic responses of copepods to polluted sediments.

An accurate assessment and prediction of Rural Ecological Environment Quality (REEQ) serves as the theoretical basis to achieving these goals, and provide scientific guidance for future rural ecological environment construction and planning. The field of regional ecology, proposed in the mid-20th century, represents an emerging interdisciplinary domain that integrates ecology, geography, and economics. It plays a pivotal role in addressing large-scale ecological challenges and fostering social sustainability. As global urbanization continues to advance, urban ecological environments undergo significant transformations under the pressures of intense human activities. Scholars have increasingly focused on the essence, evolutionary patterns, and causal mechanisms shaping urban ecological environment quality. Consequently, ecological environment assessments have evolved from singular pollution evaluations to comprehensive ecological appraisals. However, coastal rural area with complex geographical conditions and fragile ecological environments are often neglected and marginalized. Currently, there are few specialized evaluation systems for REEQ, making it difficult to accurately reveal the evolution pattern of rural ecological environment. This weakens its guidance on practical rural ecological environment governance and restoration.Methods: The Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model can simplify the identification process of driving factors for REEQ, reflect the feedback mechanism between indicators, and is conducive to scientific and accurate evaluation of REEQ. Therefore, we constructed an evaluation index system for REEQ based on the PSR. We measured REEQ in the eastern coastal area of China, analyzed its spatiotemporal characteristics and development trends, and used the obstacle degree model to identify obstacle factors. It is beneficial for rural areas to grasp the evolution laws of REEQ, provide theoretical basis for the formulation of sustainable development policies, and provide scientific policy recommendations.Results: Our findings indicate that: 1) From 2000 to 2020, REEQ in the eastern coastal area of China has continuously improved, with the index value increasing from 0.454 to 0.525, a total growth of 15.64%. The number of high-level REEQ areas increased from 0 to 29, showing a positive development trend. 2) High-density areas of REEQ in the eastern coastal area of China are concentrated in the northern parts of Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces. The center of REEQ has shifted from the southwest to the northeast. 3) The obstacle degrees of various criteria layers in REEQ are relatively stable, with the response subsystem being the highest, followed by the state and pressure subsystems. Forest coverage, per capita grain production, effective irrigation rate of farmland, afforestation area in the current year, per capita disposable income of rural residents, and per capita mechanical power of farmers are the main obstacle indicators. 4) From 2020 to 2035, REEQ in the eastern coastal area of China will continue to improve.

Using 456 microcosms, in which different bacterial mixtures with equal initial cell numbers were exposed to single or multiple predators (Tetrahymena sp., Poterioochromonas sp. and Acanthamoeba sp.), we showed that increasing prey richness enhanced production of single predators. The extent of the response depended, however, on predator identity. Bacterial prey richness had a stabilizing effect on predator performance in that it reduced variability in predator production. Further, prey richness tended to enhance predator evenness in the predation experiment including all three protists predators (multiple predation experiment). However, we also observed a negative relationship between prey richness and predator production in multiple predation experiments. Mathematical analysis of potential ecological mechanisms of positive predator diversity-functioning relationships revealed predator complementarity as a factor responsible for both enhanced predator production and prey reduction.

Crop-raiding patterns have been investigated for decades, but understanding both social and ecological determinants remains a key challenge to defining realistic management options in a context of increasing human and elephant densities. Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, and its periphery, hosts one of the highest densities of free-ranging elephants. As scale is a critical element of ecological systems, we analysed the determinants of crop raiding at three spatial scales: the study area (217 households in 200 km2), the village (30 fields in 14 km2) and the edge of the refuge area (30 fields in less than 3 km2). We combined foraging ecology with sociological approaches, including a participatory experiment, to understand the processes behind the susceptibility of subsistence farmers to crop raiding. Distance to refuge area was the most influential determinant in decreasing crop-raiding risk, with no damage occurring further than 4.4 km. We obtained consistent models between the three scales with high explanatory power for field damage at village and edge scales (94% and 68% respectively). Household density acted as an obstacle to elephants. Millet patches seemed to provide refuges, and thus promoted damage. The participatory experiment allowed rigorous testing of the efficiency of traditional guarding practices. The presence of people was crucial for guarding efficiency. More innovatively, we demonstrated the role of neighbours and the importance of cohesive guarding as a promising strategy of reducing crop loss at the edge, primarily in areas with a high density of elephant paths. Synthesis and applications. This paper provides evidence that multi-scale multidisciplinary approaches can unravel endogenous processes shaping humanelephant coexistence on the edge of protected areas.

The country has experienced many political and social transitions from British colonialism to attaining independence in 1965 and thereafter. Since independence, English-based bilingualism has been vigorously promoted as part of nation-building. While the roles of the multiple languages in use in Singapore feature prominently in the discourse on language planning, historical records show no mention of how these impacts on the deaf community. The first documented deaf person in archival documents is a Chinese deaf immigrant from Shanghai who established the first deaf school in Singapore in 1954 teaching Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL) and Mandarin. Since then, the Singapore deaf community has seen many shifts and transitions in education programming for deaf children, which has also been largely influenced by exogeneous factors such as trends in deaf education in the United States A pivotal change that has far-reaching impact on the deaf community today, is the introduction of Signing Exact English (SEE) in 1976. This was in keeping with the statal English-based bilingual narrative. The subsequent decision to replace SSL with SEE has dramatic consequences for the current members of the deaf community resulting in internal divisions and fractiousness with lasting implications for the cohesion of the community. This publication traces the origins of Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) by giving readers (and future scholars) a road map on key issues and moments in this history. Bi- and multi-lingualism in Singapore as well as external forces will also be discussed from a social and historical perspective, along with the interplay of different forms of language ideologies. All the different sign languages and sign systems as well as the written/spoken languages used in Singapore, interact and compete with as well as influence each other.

Here we draw attention to an emerging subdiscipline of artificial intelligence, explainable AI (xAI), as a toolbox for better interpreting SDMs. xAI aims at deciphering the behavior of complex statistical or machine learning models (e.g. neural networks, random forests, boosted regression trees), and can produce more transparent and understandable SDM predictions. We describe the rationale behind xAI and provide a list of tools that can be used to help ecological modelers better understand complex model behavior at different scales. As an example, we perform a reproducible SDM analysis in R on the African elephant and showcase some xAI tools such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) to help interpret local-scale behavior of the model.

However, investigating these fundamental ecological questions has been challenging due to incomplete representation of naturally occurring viral diversity in single gene-or morphology-based studies and an inability to identify up to 90% of reads in viral metagenomes (viromes). Although protein clustering techniques provide a significant advance by helping organize this unknown metagenomic sequence space, they typically use only similar to 75% of the data and rely on assembly methods not yet tuned for naturally occurring sequence variation. Here, we introduce an annotation- and assembly-free strategy for comparative metagenomics that combines shared k-mer and social network analyses (regression modeling). This robust statistical framework enables visualization of complex sample networks and determination of ecological factors driving community structure. Application to 32 viromes from the Pacific Ocean Virome dataset identified clusters of samples broadly delineated by photic zone and revealed that geographic region, depth, and proximity to shore were significant predictors of community structure. Within subsets of this dataset, depth, season, and oxygen concentration were significant drivers of viral community structure at a single open ocean station, whereas variability along onshore-offshore transects was driven by oxygen concentration in an area with an oxygen minimum zone and not depth or proximity to shore, as might be expected.

Future directions surrounding (a) the need to examine correlates at lower (i.e., biological level) and higher (i.e., institutional, community, policy) analytic levels, (b) to sample participants from more culturally diverse societies and (c) to examine sport-general attrition are offered.

The cooperative education in the development of competences attends to the proposals of territorial development materialized in programs and projects that begin to have meaning at the moment of its implementation. Even though the Mondragon Cooperative Experience arouses interest after six decades, this paper does not aim to analyze its history, achievements, contradictions, and challenges already analyzed and debated by literature. The objective is to analyze the proposals in the field of cooperative education as an enhancing factor in the articulation between productive and educational practices, it means, between reflection and action as a factor that intensifies the teaching-learning process for individual and social development. The proposal is based on a qualitative research, case study, and participant observation of the Cooperative Education Model of Mondragon, from an exploratory-descriptive-evaluative view that was carried out during a sandwich doctorate internship, in the years 2014-2015, resulting from the collaboration between two graduate programs of Brazilian universities-PUCPR and FURB - and the Institute of Cooperative Studies (Lanki) of Mondragon Unibertsitatea. To analyze the data was used the methodology of the Collective Subject Discourse (CSD) and the QualiQuantiSoft (R) software. The results show the cooperativism course of the Lanki: (1) Education processes are (re) construction and strengthening of the cooperative identity in three parts: rational-intellectual, emotional-affective and action. Lanki understands education as an integral and continuous process that encompasses the development of all dimensions of the person through interaction with their social environment. Understands education as a systematic and planned action that affects not only knowledge but also attitudes and abilities through the experience of learning in a specific context. (2) Ecological sustainability is a concern in this model but its reflection in practice is still far to become reality. Responsible consumption based on ecological, ethical, and social criteria, is at the level of reflection and not of action. The initiatives in this sense are still timid and incipient. The CSDs shows difficulties with the transmission of knowledge and competence within the cooperatives as well as to the application of the apprenticeship. The competencies for the implementation of learning are, therefore, more limited. The main points based on the qualitative reading of the evaluations obtained in the course are highlighted. The participants showed a high degree of interest. It is emphasized overall, that the topics studied are of vital importance for the development of the cooperative. There is a need to invigorate shared decision spaces to create a sense of belonging. Many of the participants acknowledge this feeling as such a certain discovery. It is emphasized that these issues have not been properly worked on in the cooperatives and it is necessary to dedicate time to them. The dialogue generated among the participants and the methodology used is particularly valued. The cooperative course classes require more time. There is a clear demand to discuss cooperativism dynamics from the social bases of the cooperatives. The cooperative education should form, first of all, cooperative men and women and then form cooperatives leaderships. In this analysis, it is concluded that the pedagogy of social practice of cooperative education, despite having an interdisciplinary approach, has difficulties to advance from reflection to action, and from discourse to practice. The development model in which the Mondragon cooperatives are immersed is a factor that hinders progress towards the sustainability of the development model by focusing on the environmental-ecological axis. One of the main challenges of the educational model analyzed is promoting the abilities and competencies of individuals for resilience in the face of social and ecological crisis. The paradigm of sustainable territorial development presupposes a set of sustainability synthesized in the trinomial of economic efficiency, environmental and social effectiveness. Despite the efforts to revitalize the socio-cooperative project, it cannot be ignored that a socioeconomic model based on the paradigm of unlimited growth. It means, it cannot achieve a sustainable territorial development without changes in the forms of production and consumption without strengthening the socio-environmental effectiveness. The cooperative education model requires a greater strengthening of praxis (articulation between theory and practice). It is necessary in order to implement the pedagogy of social practice with inter and transdisciplinary vision, which makes clear the interrelation of economic and biosphere processes. Environmental and social sustainability will be the agenda of this century. Therefore, the cooperative education shall include the environmental issues, so that produces transformations in modes of production, consumption, and of life itself to create an awareness of the limits of economic rationality. Then, the ideal of human self-realization and social emancipation inevitably arises from the integration of the socio-ecological dimension. It can be said that cooperative education for the integral development of the person is a broad concept that encompasses from technical, to social and ethical education. Education is a central issue to the integral development and self-realization, promoting the autonomy, freedom, and responsibility, which represent an enormous potential for transforming and emancipating people. On the other hand, it contributes to the strengthening of anti-hegemonic values such as solidarity, cooperation, and autonomy, promoting critical awareness, which is the basis of the processes with an enormous transforming and emancipating potential. Arizmendiarrieta said that consciences had to be transformed in structures. It means social emancipation that is conducted through cooperative education as a critical pedagogy or for social transformation. It is concluded that new spaces are needed for cooperative reflection where cooperative education should be a tool that encourages space for debate, based on dialogical and participative dynamics to share and build cooperative meaning. Cooperative education is an interesting tool to promote the debate and the collective construction of proposals. The practice accumulated in recent years shows the lack of space to recreate the cooperative identity. An important part of the cooperative is that the members should be involved in the educational processes to assure the cooperative values. In this sense, cooperativism is characterized as a more humanized model of the economy, as the term social economy suggests. Cooperative education, in turn, allows spaces for debate to work identity and cooperative practice, develop feelings of belonging and affinity to the cooperative model. The cooperativism has the greatest challenge of incorporating intergenerational rights, not only socioeconomic but also environmental, with a more robust and resilient socio-business project in the face of climate change..",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alcantara, Liliane/ABG-5778-2020; Sampaio, Carlos/I-6135-2012","Sampaio, Carlos/0000-0002-0664-0266; ALCANTARA, LILIANE/0000-0001-8502-720X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0213-8093","1989-6816",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2018,93,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"181","209",NA,"10.7203/CIRIEC-E.93.9217","http://dx.doi.org/10.7203/CIRIEC-E.93.9217",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000444482100006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Mountain metaphors, thus, have remained as key guidance in developing not only animistic belief systems and religious cults, but also military strategies, economic potential, and scientific innovation. This paper seeks to explain the need to integrate western knowledge, where mountains became known via natural history's mechanistic explanations, with other epistemologies. Mountain scientists therein developed linear approaches that required exploration, experimentation, and pragmatic interpretation of generalizable mountain phenomena. Little is known, however, about other civilizations' more encompassing cognition due to heuristic explanations of mountain myths. Local knowledge holders therein developed approaches that required familiarization, observation, and romantic meditation about situated mountain phenomena. Using a multimethod approach of human geography that includes onomastics, geocritical discourse analysis, political ecology, and critical biogeography, the author posits that there is a paradigmatic shift of geographic fad, when even nature is thought of as a social construct in the socioecological mountainscapes. Between these tendencies of either Cartesian or Spinozan dogmas about scientific objectives, methods and implications, mountains continue to elicit geographical research. The author thus concludes that integrating narratives of mountain studies with geocritical analyses of political ecology that allow for transgressivity and referentialilty of mountain cognition can be done with transdisciplinary science. Montology, henceforth, couples dialectic thinking with the trifecta of spatiality, complexity and historicity in highlighting mountain microrefugia for biocultural conservation. Use of montological approaches will bring mountain scientists to a new level, where the application of local ecological knowledge and cutting-edge technological instrumentation could render sustainable mountain communities, in dynamic biocultural heritage scenarios of convergent mountain science.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sarmiento, Fausto/AAD-2467-2020","Sarmiento, Fausto O./0000-0003-0501-6020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1672-6316","1993-0321",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2020,17,"10",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2512","2527",NA,"10.1007/s11629-019-5536-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-019-5536-2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000578876400014","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Despite this, the sustainability of global fisheries is a growing concern, and the factors enabling or constraining the sustainable management of small-scale fisheries remain poorly understood. Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) is the single most valuable species harvested in Bangladesh waters, serves nutrition, income, and employment to the large population. This study analyzed the state and challenges of hilsa fishery in the Gangetic River systems (Padma and Meghna Rivers) by using two frameworks, namely the social-ecological systems (SES) and drivers-pressure-state-impact-responses (DPSIR) frameworks. Primary data for this analysis were collected by in-depth interviews (n = 130) and focus group discussions (n = 8) with various stakeholders in the hilsa fisheries. The perspectives explored here have been both critical and constructive, including the identification of problems and suggestions for improving the management of this particular social-ecological system. Hilsa fisheries, however, have come under severe threat since 2003 because of population growth, overfishing, pollution, climate change, the disruption of migration routes due to siltation, etc. All these have caused reduced catches and less stable incomes for fishers. This, in turn, has led to poverty, malnutrition, social tensions, stakeholder conflicts, and debt cycles amongst more impoverished fishing communities. These problems have been compounded by improved fishing technology amongst larger-scale ventures, the use of illegal fishing gears, and the non-compliance of government fishery management programs. Recommendations include the promotion of community-supported fisheries, the enhancement of stakeholder's social resilience, the introduction of co-management approach, an increase in incentives and formal financial supports, and possible community-managed sustainable ecotourism including hilsa fishing-based tourism.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"wahab, Abdul/G-5345-2010; Islam, M./I-5177-2019; Schneider, Petra/H-9792-2019","Sarkki, Simo/0000-0002-7790-0600; Mozumder, Mohammad/0000-0001-6727-555X; Schneider, Petra/0000-0001-7489-9192; Islam, M Mahmudul/0000-0002-2269-6454; Pyhala, Aili/0000-0001-7095-5994",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1660-4601",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2019,16,"23",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4814","10.3390/ijerph16234814","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16234814",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31795523,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000507275700159","View Full Record in Web of Science"

With its concurrent grounding in practice and science, transdisciplinary research represents a significant departure from conventional research. We focus on mutual learning within transdisciplinary research and highlight three aspects that could guide other researchers in designing and facilitating such learning. These are: who to learn with, what to learn about and how to learn. For each of these questions, we present learning heuristics that are supported by a comparative analysis of two case studies that addressed contemporary conservation issues in South Africa but varied in scale and duration. These were a five-year national-scale project focusing on the prioritisation of freshwater ecosystems for conservation and a three-year local-scale project that used ecological infrastructure as a theme for advancing sustainability dialogues. Regarding the proposed learning heuristics, who to learn with is scale dependent and needs to be informed by relevant disciplines and policy sectors with the aim of establishing a knowledge network representing empirical, pragmatic, normative and purposive functions. This emergent network should be enriched by involving relevant experts, novices and bridging agents, where possible. It is important for such networks to learn about the respective histories, system processes and drivers, values and knowledge that exist in the social-ecological system of interest. Moreover, learning together about key concepts and issues can help to develop a shared vocabulary, which in turn can contribute to a shared understanding, a common vision and an agreed way of responding to it. New ways of group learning can be promoted and enhanced by co-developing outputs (boundary objects) for application across knowledge domains and creating spaces (third places) that facilitate exchange of knowledge and knowledge co-production. We conclude with five generic lessons for transdisciplinary researchers to enhance project success: (a) the duration, timing and continuation potential of a project influences its prospects for achieving systemic and sustainable change; (b) bridging agents, especially if embedded within an implementing agency, play a critical role in facilitating transdisciplinary learning with enhanced outcomes; (c) researchers need to participate as co-learners rather than masters of knowledge domains; (d) purposeful mixed-paradigm research designs could help to mend knowledge fragmentation within science; and (e) researchers must be vigilant for three pitfalls in mutual learning initiatives, namely biases in participant self-selection, perceived superiority of scientific knowledge and the attraction of simple solutions to wicked problems that retain the status quo.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"O'Farrell, Patrick/AAQ-7728-2021; Roux, Dirk/F-2894-2012; O'Farrell, Patrick/B-6898-2008","Roux, Dirk/0000-0001-7809-0446; Fabricius, Christo/0000-0003-2223-5671; O'Farrell, Patrick/0000-0002-9538-8831",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1862-4065","1862-4057",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2017,12,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"711","726",NA,"10.1007/s11625-017-0446-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-017-0446-0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000412686300006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This paper follows a social learning process, called participatory self-observation, piloted by a group of action-researchers to improve SES integration and monitoring, using the Tsitsa River Catchment in South Africa as a case study. The participatory self-observation process reflected on lessons to enhance integration and integrated monitoring of biophysical, social, and social-ecological data in SES projects; for adaptive planning and management. Three focal points emerged for improving the challenges of SES integration: the need for participatory people-based processes, the importance of applied praxis tasks to catalyze meaningful integration, and the need for transdisciplinary teams to value non-biophysical research. Five focal areas emerged as major challenges for SES monitoring: the integration of qualitative and quantitative data, data overload, the scale of SES monitoring, the need to center SES monitoring around learning, and good working relationships to enable data flow. Recommendations to further develop integrated monitoring and management of SESs include (i) using people-based approaches that focus on applied work which includes rigorous collection of quantitative, biophysical data, (ii) identifying essential data needs through an essential variable approach, and (iii) combining quantitative monitoring with participatory people-based processes.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Clifford-Holmes, Jai/HMD-2979-2023","Scholes, Mary/0000-0001-5762-9537; Coetzer, Kaera/0000-0001-5176-7859; Clifford-Holmes, Jai/0000-0001-5552-8652; Itzkin, Adela/0000-0003-2218-5053",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2073-445X",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2022,11,"10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1848","10.3390/land11101848","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11101848",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000872859300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The objective of the present study was to use geochemical parameters and benthic fossil foraminifera to assess environmental changes that have occurred over the last 200 years in a harbour area (Boulogne-sur-Mer, Northern France) heavily modified by human activities. A multidisciplinary approach including major and trace metals, grain-size, total organic carbon and benthic fossil foraminifera, has been performed on a 33-cm long core. The dating was carried out using the activity of Pb-210 and Cs-137. Embayment of the area and increase of trace metals concentrations induced a shift in benthic communities. Human activities modified a sandy nearshore bank, colonized by typical marine foraminiferal species, such as Cribroelphiudium excavatum, into a sheltered environment, dominated by brackish end-members, such as Haynesina germanica. Along the sedimentary record, the interaction between meiofaunal and geochemical elements made it possible to distinguish between a pre-impacted period and an industrial period. The upper part of the core reflects better ecological conditions, indicating an environmental recovery. Our results provide baselines for future environmental bio-monitoring in the area.

We first compare population levels in the coastal zone-including areas by the estuaries and sea-to inland habitats such as the floodplain. Second, we discuss resource extraction and trade associated with the coastal zone. Excavations and a 224 km2 full-coverage survey indicate that, except during the initial Early Formative period (1600-1350 BC), coastal zone habitats were not a settlement focus. Land use concentrated on the extraction of resources such as fish, salt, and ornamental shell. These goods were consumed locally and exchanged via long-distance networks for obsidian, pottery, and during the Postclassic period (AD 800-1522), copper items. Archaeofaunal and isotopic data suggest that aquatic resources from estuarine and marine environments constituted a small proportion of the total caloric input, but may have been important sources of protein. Finally, we compare settlement patterns between the lower Verde and other Mesoamerican coastal regions. Lower Verde population in the coastal zone was low, especially relative to areas which practiced mixed subsistence into the Middle/Late Formative periods (ca. 700-150 BC).

The complex ecology of these diseases creates a global health problem not easily solved with medical treatment alone. Methods:We quantified the current global disease burden caused by environmentally mediated infectious diseases and used a structural equation model to explore environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with the human burden of environmentally mediated pathogens across all countries. Findings:We found that around 80% (455 of 560) of WHO-tracked pathogen species known to infect humans are environmentally mediated, causing about 40% (129 488 of 359 341 disability-adjusted life years) of contemporary infectious disease burden (global loss of 130 million years of healthy life annually). The majority of this environmentally mediated disease burden occurs in tropical countries, and the poorest countries carry the highest burdens across all latitudes. We found weak associations between disease burden and biodiversity or agricultural land use at the global scale. In contrast, the proportion of people with rural poor livelihoods in a country was a strong proximate indicator of environmentally mediated infectious disease burden. Political stability and wealth were associated with improved sanitation, better health care, and lower proportions of rural poverty, indirectly resulting in lower burdens of environmentally mediated infections. Rarely, environmentally mediated pathogens can evolve into global pandemics (eg, HIV, COVID-19) affecting even the wealthiest communities. Interpretation:The high and uneven burden of environmentally mediated infections highlights the need for innovative social and ecological interventions to complement biomedical advances in the pursuit of global health and sustainability goals.

We combined insights from a coupled physical-biological model, parentage analyses, and field surveys to span larval dispersal pathways, endpoints, and recruitment of the convict surgeonfish Acanthurus triostegus. Our primary study region was the windward coast of O'ahu, Hawai'i. A high abundance of juvenile A. triostegus occurred along the windward coast, with the highest abundance inside Kane'ohe Bay. The output from our numerical model showed that larval release location accounted for most of the variation in simulated settlement. Seasonal variation in settlement probability was apparent, and patterns observed in model simulations aligned with in situ observations of recruitment. The bay acted as a partial retention zone, with larvae that were released within or entering the bay having a much higher probability of settlement. Genetic parentage analyses aligned with larval transport modeling results, indicating self-recruitment of A. triostegus within the bay as well as recruitment into the bay from sites outside. We conclude that Kane'ohe Bay retains reef fish larvae and promotes settlement based on concordant results from numerical models, parentage analyses, and field observations.

Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), an alien invasive species from Asia, enters a winter dormancy in response to environmental cues. We investigated the nature of this dormancy and its effects on H. halys cold tolerance, as measured by supercooling points, lower lethal temperatures, and overwintering field mortality. Dormancy was induced by rearing individuals in the laboratory or under field conditions. We confirmed H. halys dormancy to be a state of diapause and not quiescence, and the life stage sensitive to diapause-inducing cues is between the second and fifth instar. In the laboratory, supercooling points of diapausing adults reached significantly lower temperatures than nondiapausing adults, but only when given enough time after imaginal ecdysis. Supercooling points of diapausing adults in overwintering microhabitats also decreased over time. Diapause increased adult survival after acute cold exposure in the laboratory and prolonged cold exposure in the field. Following diapause induction in the laboratory, changes to temperature and photoperiod had no significant effect on lower lethal temperatures and changes to photoperiod had no effect on supercooling points. Additionally, induction of diapause in the laboratory did not result in significantly different cold tolerance than natural field induction of diapause.This work demonstrates that H. help diapause confers greater cold tolerance than a nondiapausing state and likely improves the probability of successful overwintering in some temperate climates.

Investigations into such responses have typically been focused at particular biological levels (e. g., cellular, population, community), often lacking interactions among levels. Since all levels of biological organisation are sensitive to global climate change, there is a need to elucidate how different processes and hierarchical interactions will influence species fitness. Therefore, predicting the responses of communities and populations to global change will require multidisciplinary efforts across multiple levels of hierarchy, from the genetic and cellular to communities and ecosystems.

Here, we synthesize what ecological surprise has meant to ecologists studying these events and review the development and use of the concept in ecology. We define ecological surprise as a situation where human expectations or predictions of natural system behavior deviate from observed ecosystem behavior. This can occur when people (1) fail to anticipate change in ecosystems; (2) fail to influence ecosystem behavior as intended; or (3) discover something about an ecosystem that runs counter to accepted knowledge. We develop a conceptual model that captures the interactions between social and ecological processes that lead to these events and examine two types of drivers that contribute to surprise: underlying driving forces and proximate causes. Our definition of ecological surprise inherently acknowledges that, to be surprising, there must be human observers to the ecological occurrence who have expectations about ecosystem behavior. To explore this dimension, we draw on social science perspectives to understand the ways in which human expectations of ecosystems are influenced by social networks, heuristics, and mental models. We use a case study to demonstrate how our integrated concep-tualization of ecological surprise provides a systematic way of examining these events.

Larval stages of fishes were used to assess the ecological quality status (EQS) of four NW Portuguese estuaries, with different types and magnitudes of human pressures. The larval fish assemblages, together with water column characteristics and pollution indicators (faecal contamination and nutrient load) were sampled in the Lima, Cavado, Ave and Douro estuaries, during spring and autumn 2009. The four estuaries were classified in terms of human pressures by a global pressure index that identified the Cavado estuary as the least impacted estuary, followed by the Ave and Lima, both classified as moderately impacted system, while the Douro was classified as a highly impacted system. The Ave emerged as the most polluted system, carrying the highest nutrient load and sewage contamination. Larval fish assemblages included estuarine species, marine migrants, marine stragglers and the larger estuaries had higher species richness. Compared to adult fishes, three multimetric fish-based indices classified the Cavado, Ave and Douro estuaries with a lower ecological status when fish larvae were used. Similarly, the EQS assessed by macroinvertebrates were equal or higher when compared with fish larvae results. The EQS assessed by fish larvae was negatively correlated with sewage contamination and nitrogen nutrients, but did not reflect other anthropogenic pressures expressed by the global pressure index, which was only detected by adult fish. Fish larvae assessments were able to detect short-time events of hydrological manipulations observed in the Cavado estuary, as well as a seasonal decrease of water quality especially evident in the Ave estuary. The indices used denoted some limitations to the use of fish larvae data, thus emphasising the need for new indices to test the observed tendency for lower EQS given by fish larvae. The advantages and disadvantages of using fish larvae as more sensitive and accurate bioindicators of ecosystem integrity is also discussed as a means of providing strategically important information for improved estuarine management.

Ostracoda were highly abundant during the whole hydroperiod, but their presence was restricted to habitats of reed-covered wetland at one geographical area.

Adult males' secondary dispersal coincided with the conception season in females, and males improved their potential access to females by moving to groups with higher female-to-male sex ratios and/or by increasing their dominance rank. Males that dispersed with a peer had lower fecal glucocorticoid and androgen metabolite levels than lone dispersers.

Findings - There were mixed views on the current state of sustainability education within NZ university accounting courses. Although there was a general consensus with both groups of participants that a start has been made, the integration is not wide enough and the sustainability education is not in sufficient depth. There were mixed feelings regarding the role that accountants should play in sustainability reporting; however, there was a general consensus around the fact that accountants do have a role to play. Both groups of participants indicated that it is important for sustainability education to be included in accounting courses at NZ universities. Based on the research findings, it appears that universities have to maintain or provide an optional higher undergraduate or post-graduate level paper in sustainability accounting. Evidence from lecturers' personal experience suggest that these courses better develop a student's knowledge of sustainability as they have time to take an interdisciplinary approach to teaching and take a look at big issues like how accounting can either support or hinder sustainability directions for businesses and society. Originality/value - The role that accounting educators play in integrating sustainability education at universities has been a contentious issue with a seemingly large gap between what research has defined as best education practice and what is currently being taught around the world. Although sustainability has formed the subject of extensive research over a number of years, there has been no work performed on the current state of sustainability education in accounting courses at NZ universities. Given the future challenges that NZ managers (and accountants) will face, it is important that universities which form a vital part of NZ society, equip managers (and accountants) to meet these demands. This study on perceptions of different stakeholders in relation to education for sustainable development, therefore, provides really important arguments for why there has to be further developments in this crucial area. The findings indicate that sustainability education by accounting educators is on a very much ad hoc basis. Further research needs to be conducted to drive better educational directions in sustainable development in universities.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chapman, James/I-3297-2015; Botes, Vida/ABB-9118-2020; Botes, Vida/B-5924-2014","Botes, Vida/0000-0002-9454-7482",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2040-8021","2040-803X",NA,NA,NA,NA,2014,5,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"95","124",NA,"10.1108/SAMPJ-11-2012-0041","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SAMPJ-11-2012-0041",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000213817800005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Eelgrass ecosystems are particularly susceptible to human induced stressors as they are sensitive to low light conditions and usually grow in shallow protected areas where pressure from coastal development is high. The extensive decline in coverage of eelgrass along the Swedish Northwest coast since the 1980s has largely been attributed to the effects of coastal eutrophication and overfishing. However, the impact on eelgrass from small-scale coastal development (docks and marinas) has never been investigated in this area. The aim of this study was to assess the local and large-scale effect of shading by docks and marinas on eelgrass habitats along the Swedish NW coast and to investigate the decision process behind small-scale exploitation to identify problems with the current legislation, which allows for continued exploitation of eelgrass. Through field assessments of eelgrass around docks and analysis of available data on eelgrass and dock distribution along the coast, the present study demonstrates that shading from docks reduced eelgrass coverage with on average 42-64% under and adjacent to the docks, and that floating docks affected larger areas and caused a much stronger reduction in eelgrass coverage (up to 100% loss) compared to docks elevated on poles (up to 70% reduction in coverage). The total eelgrass area negatively affected by docks and marinas along the NW coast was estimated to approximately 480 ha, an area corresponding to over 7% of the present areal coverage of eelgrass in the region. The analysis of decisions for dock construction showed that eelgrass was generally not assessed or considered in the decision process and that 69-88% of the applications were approved also in areas where eelgrass was present. Furthermore, marine protected areas only marginally reduced the approval of applications in eelgrass habitats. The continued small-scale development along the Swedish NW coast constitutes a significant threat to the already decimated coverage of eelgrass along the coast and changes in the management practices are needed in order to achieve both national and international goals on environmental status.

The combination of the three as life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) is a powerful decision support tool, but it also presents important design challenges. Among the most important challenges is how to include subjective information necessary for defining the major elements of a decision: prospects to decide among, uncertainty, risk attitudes, and preferences. Previous work on values in life cycle methods has addressed prospects, uncertainty, and risk attitudes. This article builds on that work by arguing that given LCSA's broad scope, explicit and standardized intercategory preferences are especially important for improving its value for decision makers. Practitioners should not be solely responsible for the value judgments necessary to integrate impact categories within and across environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA), social LCA (S-LCA), and life cycle costing evaluations for LCSA. Neither should this task fall entirely to decision makers, particularly as life cycle-grounded decisions are highly sensitive to value frames. Individuals are unlikely to be able to meaningfully interpret, evaluate, and determine trade-offs without support. This article thus proposes that LCSA leverage its multiple paradigms to rigorously generate explicit, empirically grounded intercategory preference archetypes for use in evaluating decision robustness, much as cultural theory-based archetypes are currently used to test robustness to risk attitudes.

Responses were coded for themes and patterns of meaning. Mixed methods were used to evaluate the urban park manager interview data in the context of visitor interview and plant community composition data collected at the same parks. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations were used to identify urban park manager and visitor perspectives correlated with different park types and their vegetation.

For this purpose, the species presence records collected by the Peruvian onboard observer program from 1997 to 2018 were used. All presence records were matched with the date (day/month/year) and location (longitude, latitude) of the corresponding oceanographic variables (sea surface temperature [SST], sea surface salinity [SSS], chlorophyll, and oxygen). Also, the future projected climate change effects on chub mackerel spatiotemporal distribution under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios by mid-(2040-2050) and end-of-the-century (2090-2100) were investigated. Ellipsoid evaluations demonstrated that models calibrated with SST and SSS had good performance. Projections for EN conditions predicted areas with high environmental suitability close and along the Peruvian coast. Contrastingly, during LN these areas were extended to the oceanic zone. The projected future scenarios showed that for the RCP 4.5 scenario, environmental suitability maps were similar to those found in LN but with persistent distribution in south-central Peru. For the RCP 8.5 scenario, habitats tended to be coastal. Based on climate refugia-areas where the bulk of the species may aggregate under future environmental change with the potential to re-expand once the stress abates-, the RCP 4.5 scenario did not show changes in the hotspots; conversely, the RCP 8.5 scenario predicted a reduction of around 47% of hotspots from 2040-2050 to 2090-2100 at 10 degrees S-18 degrees S.

These observations suggest that morphological variation is decoupled from ecological interactions in this system, and aggressive interactions between the two species do not elicit a phenotypic response as seen in other Plethodon communities.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Adams, Dean/0000-0001-9172-7894",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0018-0831",NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2008,64,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"281","289",NA,"10.1655/07-080.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1655/07-080.1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000261222600003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Multilayer networks promise the explicit integration of the social, spatial, and temporal contexts. Given the complex interplay of sociality and animal space use in heterogeneous landscapes, there remains an important gap in our understanding of the influence of scale on animal social networks. Using an empirical case study, we discuss ways of considering social, spatial, and temporal scale in the context of multilayer caribou social networks.

To protect biodiversity in coastal areas, there is an urgent need to identify conservation priorities in response to sea level rise and land use change. In this study, an integrated modeling process using a geomorphological model, species habitat models, and conservation prioritization is developed to identify conservation priorities in the face of sea level rise and land use change. We present a case study in the Matanzas River Basin of Northeast Florida that utilizes this integrated modeling approach with data for 38 focal species. We incorporate species-specific connectivity requirements in the analysis and compare the conservation priorities with existing conservation datasets including current conservation areas and the Florida Ecological Greenways Network (FEGN).

Design/methodology/approach - There are three components that seem relevant for ERC in higher education: taught courses should be closely linked with research being carried out into responsible consumption, ERC should focus on a global approach to reducing ecological impacts by changing consumption behaviour and the diversity of situations in terms of specific characteristics of local administrative areas and populations must be properly understood to adapt ERC messages and actions to significant local features. Findings - The diversity of modes of consumption and the complexity inherent in responsible consumption mean that the issue of ERC has to be considered from a global, cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspective. In the educational context, the wide variety of students, although creating some difficulties in terms of teaching, is nevertheless a positive factor, as it provides a cultural mix and encourages the appropriation of responsible consumption issues by all. Regarding the effectiveness of this type of ERC in achieving the expected outcome of reducing ecological impacts, assessment tools have to be introduced from student level to the level of the local authority as a whole.

We propose that to achieve this integration, Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) networks offer an ideal platform, because such sites enable research at ecological, cultural, and political local scales, and at the same time allow addressing these issues at a global scale. However, this socio-ecological work still requires better articulation of programs developed at multiple geographic, ecological and political scales. In addition, until now the social component considered in LTSER programs has focused on economic factors, omitting ethical dimensions. A central reason for this omission is the lack of methodologies to systematically integrate ethics into LTSER programs. As a contribution to resolve this limitation, here we develop a methodological approach that we call field environmental philosophy. It integrates ecological research and environmental ethics into biocultural education and conservation through an interrelated four-step cycle: i) interdisciplinary ecological and philosophical research, ii) composition of metaphors, and communication through simple narratives, iii) design of guided field experiences with an ecological and ethical orientation, and iv) implementation of in situ conservation areas. This cycle has been defined a posteriori, by analyzing successful experiences of biocultural research, education and conservation program at the Omora Ethnobotanical Park (OEP) in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve (CHBR). The Masters of Science in Subantarctic Conservation at the University of Magallanes (UMAG) adopted this cycle as a structured methodology to design theses and academic curricula for students who are creating innovative educational and ecotourism activities, such as Ecotourism with a Hand Lens and Ethical Birding. To articulate the programs at multiples scales, the OEP functions at the local scale as a research center in the CHBR, at the national level as a cofounder and southernmost site of the Chilean LTSER network coordinated by the Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity (IEB), Chile, and at the international level as a reserve and field station of the Subantarctic Biocultural Conservation Program that is coordinated by UMAG, IEB and the University of North Texas (UNT). This organization of nested units has permitted to synergistically articulate the work at local, national and international scales. Collaborative research has led to the discovery of biological and cultural diversity singularities in the remote Magellanic subantarctic ecoregion, enabled education and conservation work with multiple social actors and institutions, and has strengthened the incorporation of environmental philosophy into socio-ecological research. In this way, OEP's program is contributing to broaden the definition of the social (S) component in LTSER, and to generate methodologies to integrate, at multiple scales, ecological and ethical dimensions into socio-ecological research, as well as biocultural education and conservation programs, which could be implemented and assessed at other LTER sites.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Anderson, Christopher/V-4882-2019; Poole, Alexandria/IAN-6461-2023; Pizarro, Cristobal/J-8925-2014; Contador, Tamara/AAC-2161-2021; Ojeda, Jaime/HHN-1455-2022; Armesto, Juan/G-6467-2016; Anderson, Christopher/L-3815-2014; Rozzi, Ricardo/G-1047-2012; Contador Mejias, Tamara/Q-1914-2018","Anderson, Christopher/0000-0001-8120-5689; Mansilla, Andres/0000-0003-3505-7018; Rozzi, Ricardo/0000-0001-5265-8726; ojeda, jaime/0000-0003-3863-9750; Contador Mejias, Tamara/0000-0002-0250-9877; Poole, Alexandria/0000-0003-1338-7454",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0716-078X","0717-6317",NA,NA,NA,"MAR",2010,83,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"27","68",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000278692100004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Ethnographic interviews suggest that traditional swidden agricultural cycles removed tree roots, causing the loess sediments to lose cohesion, slump, and the terrace risers to retreat uphill over time. This evidence is supported by landslide debris at terracette faces. Archaeological analysis of terracette sites reveal remains of rammed spread soil structures, bones, stone tools, and ceramics dating from at least 2200 years before present within a distinct paleosol layer.

For wideranging species, such as cetaceans, especially considering that their marine habitats include offshore areas, collection of such data is challenging. In the absence of dedicated surveys, alternative methodologies are needed, such as the use of data collected from platforms of opportunity and modelling techniques to predict distribution in unsurveyed areas. Using 6 years of cetacean occurrence data collected along cargo ship routes between the Iberian Peninsula, northwestern African coasts and the Macaronesian islands, we developed ecological niche models to assess habitat preferences and predict suitable habitats of the eight most frequently sighted cetacean taxa in the area. Explanatory variables used for model fitting included topographic, oceanographic, detectability, geographic and seasonal features. To provide a robust habitat characterisation, along with predictions of habitat suitability, making best use of occurrence datasets, we applied two modelling techniques, GAM and Maxent, which offer complementary strengths. Coastal areas provide important habitats for common and bottlenose dophins, while other dolphin species (spotted and striped dolphins) have a more oceanic distribution. The predicted niches of Cuvier's beaked whale and minke whales are mainly in the high seas at northern latitudes. Suitable habitats for sperm whales and pilot whales are mostly in southern areas in continental slope regions. For all the species, models indicated that areas around seamount features offer suitable habitats, likely of high relevance in oligotrophic offshore waters. As such, dedicated survey effort in such areas would facilitate development and implementation of appropriate management plans, which are currently lacking.

Until recently, civil engineers largely attempted to expel water from the landscape as fast as possible. Over the past three decades, however, engineers have begun to articulate new mechanisms for responding to flooding that store stormwater in the urban landscape. In this paper, I analyse the construction of what are commonly referred to as piscinoes, large-scale detention ponds that pool stormwater in the event of heavy rain events. Drawing from literature in urban political ecology, I argue that piscinoes attempt to correct for a complex and unequal landscape, but that they do so in a way that mainly prioritises large-scale engineering solutions to the problem of flooding. As such, in spite of being hailed as indicative of a paradigm shift in flood management, piscinoes are instead a continuation of the city's broader hydraulic and urban paradigms. In response, I consider alternative approaches to the development of multifunctional piscinoes that could serve both social and ecological aims.

We use sequential principal components analysis to investigate the connectedness within the social-ecological system as a measure of resilience. We also use published literature to help develop a system dynamic framework in order to investigate how ES and HWB are interlinked. Overall, our results support previous work, which depicts that material wellbeing (basic materials for a good life) having a strong relationship with provisioning services, which in turn, show a weak relationship with the quality of life (security and health). Moreover, our analysis confirms the 'Environmentalist's Paradox' that HWB has increased despite the deterioration in ES. However, our results suggest that provisioning services are not the only important reason for the increases in observed HWB, as these have also been substantially influenced by technology and capital investment (aid and subsidy). In addition, worsening trends in regulation services and in 'slow' variables such as climate suggest that the resilience of the overall social-ecological system is decreasing. Such changes may have severe consequences if they continue, for example, if temperatures exceed the upper physiological limits of key provisioning services (e.g. rice, fish) in the Bangladesh delta.

This predicament is further compounded by the dependency of rural people on a range of non-timber forest resources for their subsistence and income. A forestry master plan recently prepared for Sri Lanka has not given adequate recognition to the important role played by non-timber forest resources in rural livelihood. This oversight is primarily due to the lack of quantitative information to justify the role of non-timber forest resources in forestry sector development. Forestry policies that ignore these resources often anger local people, leading the villagers to vent their disapproval through destructive actions such as burning timber plantations. Long-term interdisciplinary research in ecology, reproductive and soil biology, ethnobiology, silviculture, rural sociology and resource economics in progress at Sinharaja attempts to address these questions of sustainable development of forest resources in an integrated mode. While research oriented toward conservation investigates both short- and long-term ecosystem dynamics in natural and modified forest stands, utilization-oriented research probes the impact of increased human disturbance, particularly the impact of rural communities on dwindling forest resources, as well as the effect of forest conservation on rural livelihood.

As beaks of cephalopods are recurrently found in top predator's stomachs, we studied the feeding ecology of both octopods through the evaluation of niche overlapping and specific beak adaptations that both species present. A multidisciplinary approach combining carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope signatures, mercury (Hg) analysis and biomaterials' engineering techniques was applied to investigate the beaks.

Our knowledge of these signals has progressed dramatically, and now includes good characterizations of the bioactivities, modes of action, biosynthesis, and genetic programming of numerous compounds affecting a wide range of species. A major challenge now is to integrate this information so as to better understand actual selective pressures under natural conditions, make meaningful predictions about how organisms and ecosystems will respond to a changing environment, and provide useful guidance to managers who must contend with difficult trade-offs among competing socioeconomic values. One approach is to place stronger emphasis on cross-scale interactions, an understanding of which can help us better connect pattern with process, and improve our ability to make mechanistically grounded predictions over large areas and time frames. The opportunity to achieve such progress has been heightened by the rapid development of new scientific and technological tools. There are significant difficulties, however: Attempts to extend arrays of lower-scale processes into higher scale functioning can generate overly diffuse patterns. Conversely, attempts to infer process from pattern can miss critically important lower-scale drivers in systems where their biological and statistical significance is negated after critical thresholds are breached. Chemical signaling in bark beetle - conifer interactions has been explored for several decades, including by the two pioneers after whom this award is named. The strong knowledge base developed by many researchers, the importance of bark beetles in ecosystem functioning, and the socioeconomic challenges they pose, establish these insects as an ideal model for studying chemical signaling within a cross-scale context. This report describes our recent work at three levels of scale: interactions of bacteria with host plant compounds and symbiotic fungi (tree level, biochemical time), relationships among inducible and constitutive defenses, population dynamics, and plastic host-selection behavior (stand level, ecological time), and climate-driven range expansion of a native eruptive species into semi-na < ve and potentially na < ve habitats (geographical level, evolutionary time).

Clustering observed in permutation based multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and PCoA plot of UniFrac distances between intra-patient longitudinal oral-stool sample pairs suggested potential oral-stool microbial community coalescence. Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and UniFrac distances were used to create an objective definition of microbial community coalescence.

This was validated through a linear mixed model which determined that patients who experienced coalescence had an increased proportion of shared to unique OTUs between their oral-stool sample pairs over time compared to non-coalesced patients.

Monitoring of the nesting populations is therefore important to estimate the state of a population and its future. However, measuring the clutch size and frequency of sea turtles is tedious work that requires rigorous monitoring of the nesting site throughout the breeding season. In order to support the fieldwork, we propose an automatic method to remotely record the behavior on land of the sea turtles from animal-attached sensors; an accelerometer. The proposed method estimates, with an accuracy of 95%, the behaviors on land of sea turtles and the number of eggs laid. This automatic method should therefore help researchers monitor nesting sea turtle populations and contribute to improving global knowledge on the demographic status of these threatened species. Monitoring reproductive outputs of sea turtles is difficult, as it requires a large number of observers patrolling extended beaches every night throughout the breeding season with the risk of missing nesting individuals. We introduce the first automatic method to remotely record the reproductive outputs of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) using accelerometers. First, we trained a fully convolutional neural network, the V-net, to automatically identify the six behaviors shown during nesting. With an accuracy of 0.95, the V-net succeeded in detecting the Egg laying process with a precision of 0.97. Then, we estimated the number of laid eggs from the predicted Egg laying sequence and obtained the outputs with a mean relative error of 7% compared to the observed numbers in the field. Based on deployment of non-invasive and miniature loggers, the proposed method should help researchers monitor nesting sea turtle populations. Furthermore, its use can be coupled with the deployment of accelerometers at sea during the intra-nesting period, from which behaviors can also be estimated. The knowledge of the behavior of sea turtle on land and at sea during the entire reproduction period is essential to improve our knowledge of this threatened species.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DAMIEN, CHEVALLIER/N-6532-2013; Damien, CHEVALLIER/LFU-0535-2024","Damien, CHEVALLIER/0000-0002-2232-6787",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2076-2615",NA,NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2022,12,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"520","10.3390/ani12040520","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12040520",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35203228,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000770896700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This paper aims to examine climate adaptation trade-offs, uncertainties, and maladaptation through an interdisciplinary analysis of two interacting pathways of transformational adaptation in the Philippines: the post 2004 disaster rural transformations in the coconut-producing municipality of Infanta and a state-led urban water resilience strategy for the capital region of Metro Manila.

We focus on a West African country (Benin) to assess the medicinal and spiritual values of pangolins among different ethnic groups and identify the cohort of buyers involved in the pangolin trade and related economic values along the chain, notably from local diasporas.MethodsWe organised 54 focus groups in villages surrounding occurrence habitats of pangolins across Benin and conducted 35 individual interviews with vendors from five major traditional medicine markets (TMMs). Our questionnaire addressed the different uses of pangolins, the commercial value of pangolin items, the categories of clients and the related selling prices.ResultsPangolin meat was strictly consumed as food. Scales, head, bones, tongue, blood, heart and xiphisternum were the items used by local communities as part of medicinal (65% of the focus groups) and spiritual (37%) practices. Scales were the most frequently used item (use value index = 1.56). A total of 42 medicinal and spiritual uses, covering 15 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) categories, were recorded among ethnic groups. The ICD and spiritual categories-based analyses of similarity showed a partial overlapping of ethnozoological knowledge across Benin, although knowledge was significantly influenced by ethnicity and geographic location. The pricing of pangolins both varied with the category of stakeholders (local communities vs. stakeholders of TMMs) and clients (local and West African clients vs. Chinese community) and the type of items sold. The Chinese community was reported to only buy pangolins alive, and average selling prices were 3-8 times higher than those to West African clients.ConclusionsOur results confirm that pangolins in Africa are valuable and versatile resources for consumption and medicinal / spiritual practices. The pangolin trade in Benin is based on an endogenous and complex network of actors that now appears influenced by the specific, high-valued demand from the Chinese diaspora.

We tested the hypothesis that group size varies across ecological contexts, including population density, habitat type, and season, for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in ten herds over 25 years in Newfoundland, Canada. We predicted that group size would increase as a function of population density. Based on the foraging benefits of social aggregation, we predicted larger groups as habitat openness increased because open areas tend to have higher quality foraging resources. We predicted larger groups during winter when foraging resources are covered in snow because caribou and other social animals exploit social information about the location of foraging resources. In contrast to our prediction, group size decreased as a function of population density. In support of our prediction, group size was larger in winter than calving and summer, and we found that group size increased with habitat openness in some, but not all, cases.

Different mechanisms have been proposed to facilitate coexistence in plant communities, where space is an important resource. Using a stochastic cellular automaton simulation model we analyze - separately and in combination - the influence of different species traits and processes which alter local competition on the coexistence of plant species over a fixed time horizon. We show that different species traits operate on different time scales in competition. We therefore suggest the concept of weak versus strong traits according to short- or long-term exclusion of species differing in these traits. As a consequence, highly non-linear trade-offs between weak and strong traits can result in communities. Furthermore, we found that trade-offs based on physiological species traits such as plant lifetime, dispersal range and plant growth, did not support broad and long-term coexistence-further processes such as density-dependent mortality and light-dependent colonization were necessary. This suggests that coexistence in plant communities requires (stabilizing) local processes to support the (equalizing) trade-offs in species traits. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, such studies remain inconclusive regarding whether motor brain structures are recruited directly in language processing or through post-linguistic conceptual imagery. In the present study, we introduce a grip-force sensor that allows online measurements of language-induced motor activity during sentence listening. We use this tool to investigate whether language-induced motor activity remains constant or is modulated in negative, as opposed to affirmative, linguistic contexts. Methodology/Principal Findings: Participants listened to spoken action target words in either affirmative or negative sentences while holding a sensor in a precision grip. The participants were asked to count the sentences containing the name of a country to ensure attention. The grip force signal was recorded continuously. The action words elicited an automatic and significant enhancement of the grip force starting at approximately 300 ms after target word onset in affirmative sentences; however, no comparable grip force modulation was observed when these action words occurred in negative contexts. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings demonstrate that this simple experimental paradigm can be used to study the online crosstalk between language and the motor systems in an ecological and economical manner. Our data further confirm that the motor brain structures that can be called upon during action word processing are not mandatorily involved; the crosstalk is asymmetrically governed by the linguistic context and not vice versa.

Although wildfire smoke is considered a growing risk to public health, few studies have investigated the impacts of wildfire smoke on wildlife, particularly among species that are vulnerable to smoke inhalation. In this review, we synthesized research to date on how wildfire smoke affects the health and behavior of wildlife. After executing a systematic search using Web of Science, we found only 41 relevant studies. We synthesized findings from this literature and incorporated knowledge gained from fields outside wildlife science, specifically veterinary medicine and air pollution toxicology. Although studies that directly investigated effects of smoke on wildlife were few in number, they show that wildfire smoke contributes to adverse acute and chronic health outcomes in wildlife and influences animal behavior. Our review demonstrates that smoke inhalation can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, respiratory distress, neurological impairment, respiratory and cardiovascular disease, oxidative stress, and immunosuppression in wildlife, including terrestrial and aquatic species, and these health effects can contribute to changes in movement and vocalization. Some species also use smoke as a cue to engage in fire-avoidance behaviors or to conserve energy. However, our review also highlights significant gaps in our understanding of the impacts of wildfire smoke on wildlife. Most notably, the lack of robust air pollution measurements in existing studies limits meta-analyses and hinders construction of dose-response relationships, thereby precluding predictions of health outcomes and behaviors under different air quality conditions, especially during extreme smoke events.

Generalized additive models showed that counts of seal groups (all age classes) and pups were associated with later survey dates, deeper water, and habitat with bright Landsat 8 pixel values and intermediate pixel variability, which in turn were correlated with deep snow and surface roughness. We observed shallow snow depths, early sea-ice breakup, and high seal densities consistent with the extreme lack of ice available in 2019.

The purpose of this study is to assess the relevance of drought as a driving force for losses of livelihood security leading to a specific systemic change households abandoning transhumant pastoralism. We present and apply a framework for systematic analyses of the social ecological functioning of pastoral resource use that consists of the following components: (1) A spatially-explicit social ecological model for analyzing the system dynamics, especially in face of severe drought in connection with other driving forces of variability, (2) an operationalized measure for assessing livelihood security, and (3) a strategy for systematic vulnerability assessments of pastoral households by scenario comparison. This approach is applied to the land use system of the transhumant pastoralists in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. The results indicate that drought is the main threat to livelihood security in only a few cases, eventually forcing households to abandon their transhumant lifestyle. Instead, other (endogenous and exogenous) sources of variability were found to be the main driving force for vulnerability, depending on the household characteristics such as income needs and the level of pastoral mobility. We discuss implications on the role of severe drought in connection with other processes of global change such as social change and land use change for livelihood security in pastoral systems. Moreover, on the basis of these findings, we discuss how the relevance of shocks as a driving force of systemic changes in coupled human-nature-systems may be adequately explored.

Varying the fertilizer application rates produced no significant effect on the percentage of shoot elongation.

We applied a three-step sequence to three urbanizing catchment basins in Oregon, to: (1) simulate landscape change under four future development scenarios with the agent-based model Envision; (2) model resultant hydrological change using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); and (3) assess scenario impacts on streamflow regimes using 10 flow metrics that encompass all major flow components. Our results projected significant flow regime changes in all three basins. Urbanization impacts aligned closely with increases in flow regime flashiness and severity of extreme flow events.

Prompt and effective emergency management of acute events like oil spills is highly dependent on the social, institutional, and ecological context. In August 2020, the wreckage of the MV Wakashio spilled 1000 tonnes of fuel oil along an ecologically sensitive coastline in Pointe d'Esny, Mauritius. In October 2021, an offshore pipeline split and released 78 tonnes of crude oil off the coast of Huntington Beach in California. We compare responses among three sets of stakeholders (government, non-governmental organizations, and local residents) during the first 10 days of both oil spills, which also occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Mauritius, unfavorable weather conditions and COVID-19-related border closures that delayed international support impeded government action, creating a leadership and trust vacuum among residents regarding the immediate cleanup response. This perceived gap was subsequently complemented by NGOs coordinating improvised artisanal boom production and local volunteer cleanup efforts, with limited protection or public health training. By contrast, prompt state and local government intervention in Huntington Beach created a clear chain of command with NGOs and residents deferring to official guidance. In both cases, the oil spills created new policy opportunities to improve emergency management plans and reduce future risks. Our results demonstrate the influence of prior local expertise in managing earlier disasters and resources on governmental and organizational capacity. Incorporating and ensuring on-the-ground disaster expertise in response activities improves government-led crisis response, subsequently protecting ecosystems and residents.

A second, more transient group of microbes reside in the digesta, or feces, and are primarily influenced by environmental factors such as the host diet.

Today, remnant isolated wetlands are often overgrown and hydrologically altered due to fire exclusion or incompatible, cool season fire regimes. In the absence of warm season fires when wetlands are dry, shrubs and trees succeed herbaceous plants, which alters wetland productivity via effects on light and detritus quality. We used a factorial aquatic mesocosm study to test the effects of altered detritus and shade on the growth, development, and survival of tadpoles of two priority amphibian species: gopher frogs (Rana capito) and ornate chorus frogs (Pseudacris ornata). Gopher frog survival was higher among maidencane, sedge, and pine treatments compared to oak and sweetgum treatments. While gopher frog larval periods were lowest in the sedge treatment, there was a nominal general effect of litter type on gopher frog larval periods, growth rates, and mass at metamorphosis. Shading had a nominal and inconsistent effect on gopher frog growth rates, but did extend larval periods in all litter treatments, decreased survival in all litter treatments except oak, and decreased mass at metamorphosis in all litter treatments except pine and sweetgum. Ornate chorus frog survival was minimally affected by shading and litter treatments, but growth rates and mass at metamorphosis were highest in maidencane and sedge treatments, and larval periods were extended with shading in all litter treatments. Shading also decreased growth rates in maidencane and sedge litters and decreased mass at metamorphosis in pine and sweetgum litters. Our results demonstrate that succession of isolated wetlands can reduce tadpole performance for two priority species both through changes in leaf litter and shading, though the effect on survival, larval growth, larval period, and size at metamorphosis can differ between species.

The computation of runoff relies on key environmental factors such as land use, soil texture, slope and precipitation.

Identifying species that may be useful indicators and elucidating these mechanistic links provides insight into current ecological dynamics and may inform predictions of future ecosystem responses to climatic change. We examine humpback whale response to environmental variability through stable isotope analysis of diet over a dynamic 20-year period (1993-2012) in the California Current System (CCS). Humpback whale diets captured two major shifts in oceanographic and ecological conditions in the CCS. Isotopic signatures reflect a diet dominated by krill during periods characterized by positive phases of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), cool sea surface temperature (SST), strong upwelling and high krill biomass. In contrast, humpback whale diets are dominated by schooling fish when the NPGO is negative, SST is warmer, seasonal upwelling is delayed and anchovy and sardine populations display increased biomass and range expansion.

We find that, similar to previous studies, landowners consider the potential socioeconomic and ecological benefits of invasive species control and express a strong desire to enhance native biodiversity. However, we also find that landowners take into account the complexity of the local social and ecological context in which a program will unfold in three ways: they consider (1) the level of contribution by other landowners and urban residents who are benefiting from collective control efforts; (2) the potential for the program to upset the local ecological balance, leading to increases in other pests; and (3) the probability that the program will be successful given the likelihood of others participating and control tactics being effective.

At the same time, agriculture production also depends on relatively stable socio-ecological conditions to ensure quality and yield. Understanding how producers in agricultural landscapes can increase adaptive capacity, and remain resilient in the face of these challenges has become a priority for farmers, for researchers and national political agendas on a global scale. The current state of knowledge on adaptation tends to focus overwhelmingly on hard adaptation, such as infrastructure and technological inputs, rather than softer strategies, such as agroecological management or social capital, which are less easily measured. This research aims to explore soft strategies for adaptive capacity, in particular, the effect of social capital on the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems, using a case study of the agricultural landscape in the Okanagan Bioregion. The findings suggest that soft adaptation is a vital strategy for cultivating agricultural resilience, and underpins the ability of producers to use other soft and hard adaptation strategies. Participants in this research highlighted the importance of social connection, networks, reciprocity, learning and knowledge transferral, as key tools used to increase their adaptive capacity. They also highlight social capital as a building block for other forms of capital, such as financial, physical and environmental capitals. Despite this importance of soft adaptation, participants also indicated that they would be more likely to focus on implementing harder strategies that respond more directly and tangibly to key disturbances, rather than soft strategies. These results suggest a contradiction between the importance and value that producers place on social capital and soft adaptation, and the strategies they actually plan to implement. Further research is required to understand this contradiction, and to explore how to communicate the value of soft adaptation to producers in a way that makes the benefits more concrete and observable, and allows them to capitalize on the currency of connection.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"De Grandpre, Ayla/GRY-0512-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2673-3218",NA,NA,NA,"OCT 31",2022,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"980888","10.3389/fagro.2022.980888","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fagro.2022.980888",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001007029900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Although other types of fiber, like natural, do not rely under this classification, there is a potential for them to act as a vector of toxic substances to biota in the same way as microplastics do. Consequently all types of fiber have the potential to cause variable ecologic and socioeconomic impacts. In this scenario, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of washing parameters in the emission of fibers on textiles with different characteristics and fiber content: cotton, acrylic, polyester and polyamide. For this purpose individual garments were sequentially washed with and without detergent. Results showed that the use of a detergent reduced significantly the mass of particles emitted from synthetic garments but not from cotton, which, in relative terms, was responsible for the highest emissions. Textile characteristics such as mass availability and fiber cohesion influenced results, where shorter irregular fibers and lower tenacities dealt to higher releases. For all types of garments tested, 10 sequential cycles decreased particles' release, with peaks in three firsts washes (from 37% to 76%). Taking into account a regular washing machine filter, a considerable mass of fibers (from 40% to 75%) was not retained by this device, indicating a potential for improvement. Together, simple solutions as the use of detergents, three pre-washes and superimposed filter meshes, could diminish >53% of this type of pollution. Besides this potential reduction, globally, in one year, domestic washing machines would still contribute with around 15 thousand tonnes of cotton and synthetic fibers. A structured and sustained solution for this problem should advance in an interdisciplinary approach, fomenting responsibility from plural actors, taken in all stages of products' life cycle.

Researchers in diverse fields have suggested that complex systems do not have single stable equilibria in the long term because of inevitable perturbation. During this study, we sought to address the general question of whether or not stable social-ecological equilibria exist in highly stressed and managed lacustrine systems. Using an integrated human-biophysical model, we investigated the impacts of a species invasion and ecosystem restoration on SES equilibrium, defined here as a compromise in phosphorus management among opposing stakeholders, in western Lake Erie. Our integrated model is composed of a calibrated ecological submodel representing Sandusky Bay, and a phosphorus management submodel that reflects the societal benefits and costs of phosphorus regulation. These two submodels together form a dynamic feedback loop that includes freshwater ecology, ecosystem services, and phosphorus management. We found that the invasion of dreissenid mussels decreased ecosystem resistance to eutrophication, necessitating increased phosphorus management to preserve ecosystem services and thus creating the potential for a shift in social-ecological equilibrium. Additionally, our results suggest that net benefits in the region following the invasion of dreissenids may never again reach the pre-invasion level if on-site phosphorus control is the sole management lever. Further demonstrating transient system stability, large-scale wetland restoration shifted points of management compromise to states characterized by less on-site phosphorus management and higher environmental quality, resulting in a significant increase in net benefits in the region. We conclude that lacustrine SESs are open and dynamic, and we recommend that future models of these systems emphasize site-specific perturbation over equilibrium, thereby aiding the development of management plans for building system resistance to undesirable change that are both flexible and sustainable in an unknowable future.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Roy, Eric/C-7896-2018; Conroy, Joseph/C-4463-2008","Irwin, Elena/0000-0001-7908-5964; Roy, Eric/0000-0001-6315-3061; Conroy, Joseph/0000-0002-9561-7294",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1708-3087",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2010,15,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"20",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000277933900012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The acute toxic effects of nC(60) have been largely investigated, but studies of behavioural and chronic toxicity at sublethal doses are still rare and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. The present study investigated behavioural and chronic toxicity of nC(60) to Daphnia magna. The results showed that, in response to nC(60) exposure, hopping, heartbeat frequencies and feeding ability of D. magna decreased significantly, displaying negative relationship with exposure time and dose. Chronic treatments with 0.1 mg/L or 1 mg/L nC(60) for 21 days significantly reduced survival and reproduction of D. magna. These harmful effects suggested negative impacts of nC(60) on aquatic ecosystems. Moreover, transcriptome analysis showed that the behavioural and chronic toxicity of nC(60) to D. magna might be related to physiological functions such as cell structural repair, protein degradation, energy metabolism and reproduction. We found that nC(60) accumulated in guts of D. magna, which should be responsible for the decrease of food ingestion and consequently inhibiting energy intake. Deficiency of energy not only affects behaviours but also declines reproduction in D. magna. Overall, this is the first study comprehensively considered the behavioral and chronic toxicity of nC(60) to aquatic organism.

In the Amazon delta, natural and anthropogenic perturbations are continuously degrading key ecosystem services, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the regulation of water balance, and the modulation of regional climate patterns.

We approached these questions using a 473 day long litterbag experiment. We found that age-class beech and spruce forests (high forest management intensity) had significantly higher decomposition rates and nutrient release (most nutrients) than unmanaged deciduous forest reserves (P < 0.05). The site with near-to-nature forest management (low forest management intensity) exhibited no significant differences in litter decomposition rate, C release, lignin decomposition, and C/N, lignin/N and ligninolytic enzyme patterns compared to the unmanaged deciduous forest reserves, but most nutrient dynamics examined in this study were significantly faster under such near-to-nature forest management practices. Analyzing the activities of ligninolytic enzymes provided evidence that different forest system management practices affect litter decomposition by changing microbial enzyme activities, at least over the investigated time frame of 473 days (laccase, P < 0.0001; manganese peroxidase (MnP), P=0.0260).

It is the dominant seagrass species in the Gulf of Aqaba (GoA; northern Red Sea), where it grows in both shallow and deep environments (1-50 m depth). Native to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean, this species has invaded the Mediterranean and has recently established itself in the Caribbean Sea. Due to its invasive nature, there is growing interest to understand this species' capacity to adapt to new conditions, which might be attributed to its ability to thrive in a broad range of ecological niches. In this study, a multidisciplinary approach was used to depict variations in morphology, biochemistry (pigment and phenol content) and epiphytic bacterial communities along a depth gradient (4-28 m) in the GoA. Along this gradient, H. stipulacea increased leaf area and pigment contents (Chlorophyll a and b, total Carotenoids), while total phenol contents were mostly uniform. H. stipulacea displayed a well conserved core bacteriome, as assessed by 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene reads amplified from metagenomic DNA.

Overall, results highlighted a different ecological status of H. stipulacea at the edges of the gradient (4-28 m), where plants showed not only marked differences in morphology and biochemistry, but also the most distinct associated bacterial consortium.

This study delves into the challenges and strategies associated with managing UGS in the metropolitan region of S & atilde;o Paulo (MRSP), Brazil, comparing the experiences of the municipalities to provide empirical evidence that can inform policy making and urban planning practices in similar contexts. A structured questionnaire was distributed to environmental departments across 39 municipalities in MRSP. The survey included questions on population size, priority given to UGS, challenges faced and strategies adopted to overcome barriers. Chi-square tests were used to analyze the association between municipality size and the identified challenges and strategies. This study found that larger municipalities face significant barriers related to high population density and land use conflicts, which are less pronounced in smaller municipalities. However, strategies adopted to manage UGS were similar across all municipalities. Policy makers should focus on promoting vertical green spaces, expanding urban greening programs, and ensuring equitable resource allocation. Public-private partnerships and community involvement in planning processes are crucial for sustainable UGS management. Integrating UGS policies with broader urban development plans is essential for creating cohesive urban environments. Further research should conduct comparative studies across multiple metropolitan regions in different countries to provide a more comprehensive understanding of UGS management globally.

Our results show that habitat conditions were generally stable over the 7-year period, with small-scale variability related to tidal periodicity and local temperature anomalies. Likewise, the mussel and zoanthid assemblages exhibited remarkable stability. Changes in fluid exposure and substratum instability induced decimetrescale movements of the mussel assemblage. Microbial mats displayed infra-annual changes characterised by aperiodic growth and decline. Their development patterns could not be entirely attributed to environmental conditions, because other factors, including biotic interactions, appeared to be involved.

This computational cell biology study allows drawing far reaching hypotheses about the mechanism and the regulation of nutrient exchange and proposes that the cooperation between plant and fungus can be in fact the result of a competition between both for the same resources in the tiny periarbuscular space. The minimal model presented here may serve as benchmark to evaluate in future the performance of more complex models of AM nutrient exchange.

However, as seasonal conditions alter the distribution of resources across a landscape, they can change the priority of group members and require groups to adapt and respond collectively across changing contexts. Little is known about how stable group-living animals collectively modify their movement behaviour in response to environment changes, such as those induced by seasonality. Further, it remains unclear how environment-induced changes in group-level movement behaviours might scale up to affect population-level properties, such as a population's footprint. Methods Here we studied the collective movement of each distinct social group in a population of vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum), a largely terrestrial and non-territorial bird. We used high-resolution GPS tracking of group members over 22 months, combined with continuous time movement models, to capture how and where groups moved under varying conditions, driven by seasonality and drought. Results Groups used larger areas, travelled longer distances, and moved to new places more often during drier seasons, causing a three-fold increase in the area used at the population level when conditions turned to drought. By contrast, groups used smaller areas with more regular movements during wetter seasons. Conclusions The consistent changes in collective outcomes we observed in response to different environments raise questions about the role of collective behaviour in facilitating, or impeding, the capacity for individuals to respond to novel environmental conditions. As droughts will be occurring more often under climate change, some group living animals may have to respond to them by expressing dramatic shifts in their regular movement patterns.

Further, drought impacts may be altered by other anthropogenic stressors, such as eutrophication. We found drought dramatically reduced density of invasive Lepidium latifolium in salt marshes, and this die-back was mitigated by nutrient addition. In a 3-yr field experiment (2014-2016) conducted during an unprecedented drought (2012-2015), we tracked the effects of drought and nutrient addition on the plant community. We conducted this research at four salt marshes across a salinity gradient in the San Francisco Bay, California, USA. We manipulated paired native and invaded plots, one-half of which were treated monthly with N and P for 1.5 yr during the most intense period of the drought and one subsequent wet winter. In addition, we monitored unmanipulated L. latifolium-invaded transects within our freshest and most saline sites throughout the three years of our manipulative experiment and one additional wet winter. We documented a dramatic die-back of invasive L. latifolium during extreme drought, with reductions in stem density (52-100%) and height (17-47%) that were more severe at low salinity sites than high salinity sites. We found nutrient application lessened the effect of drought on L. latifolium stem density, but not height. In native plots, extreme drought reduced native plant cover (4-24%), but nutrient addition mitigated this impact. Interestingly, native plants in invaded plots did not suffer reductions in cover due to drought, perhaps because they were simultaneously benefiting from the die-back of the invader. Our results show drought negatively impacted both native and invasive plants and this impact was stronger on the invader, which experienced persistent declines two years after the end of the drought.

Valuable information about the status and resilience of marine ecosystems can be obtained through the monitoring of key indicator species, such as cetaceans. In this study, fatty acid profiles and phthalates were examined in blubber biopsies of free-ranging individuals from two delphinid species (short-finned pilot whale - Globicephala macrorhynchus, , n = 45; common bottlenose dolphin - Tursiops truncatus, , n = 39) off Madeira Island (NE Atlantic). This investigation aimed to explore the relations between trophic niches (epipelagic vs. mesopelagic), contamination levels, and the health status of individuals within different ecological and biological groups (defined by species, residency patterns and sex). Multivariate analysis of selected dietary fatty acids revealed a clear niche segregation between the two species. Di-n-butylphthalate (DBP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were the most prevalent among the seven studied phthalates, with the highest concentration reached by DEHP in a bottlenose dolphin (4697.34 +/- 113.45 ng/g). Phthalates esters (PAEs) concentration were higher in bottlenose dolphins (Mean & sum; PAEs: 947.56 +/- 1558.34 ng/g) compared to pilot whales (Mean & sum; PAEs: 229.98 +/- 158.86 ng/g). In bottlenose dolphins, DEHP was the predominant phthalate, whereas in pilot whales, DEP and DBP were more prevalent. Health markers suggested pilot whales might suffer from poorer physiological conditions than bottlenose dolphins, although high metabolic differences were seen between the two species. Phthalate levels showed no differences by ecological or biological groups, seasons, or years. This study is the first to assess the extent of plastic additive contamination in free-ranging cetaceans from a remote oceanic island system, underscoring the intricate relationship between ecological niches and contaminant exposure.

These benefits can occur at different biological levels. For example, endosymbiosis promotes efficiency of the cell metabolism, cell replication, and the generation of a macroscopic layer that protects the organism from its predators. Therefore, modeling endosymbiosis requires a complex-systems and multilevel approach. We propose a model of endosymbiosis based on reaction networks, where species of the reaction network represent either ecological species, resources, or conditions for the ecological interactions to happen, and the endosymbiotic interaction mechanisms are represented by different sequences of reactions (processes) in the reaction network. As an example, we develop a toy model of the coral endosymbiotic interaction.

It might substantially support successful mastering of major global challenges. In the first part of the article, the Current state of biomimetics is reviewed, and goals and visions of biomimetics are presented. Subsequently, possible biomimetic scenarios to overcome the major global challenges, as indicated by the Millennium Project, are envisaged. Those of the 15 challenges (Sustainable development, water, population and resources, democratization, long-term perspectives, information technology, the rich-poor gap, health, capacity to decide, peace and conflict, status of women, transnational crime, energy, science and technology, and global ethics) where biomimetics might provide relevant contributions are considered in more detail. The year 2059 will mark the 100th anniversary of Part C of the Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science. By this time, some of these challenges will hopefully have been Successfully dealt with, possibly with major contribution from biomimetics. A new Leitwissenschaft and a new type of 'biological technology' are emerging, and in biology more and more causation and natural laws are being uncovered. In order to estimate the fields of biology from which technical innovations are likely to appear, the amount of causal knowledge is estimated by comparing it with correlational knowledge in the respective fields. In some fields of biology, Such as biochemistry and physiology, the amount of causal laws is high, whereas in fields Such as developmental biology and ecology, we are just at the beginning. However, sometimes ideas and inspirations can also stem from nature when the causations are not known. The biomimetic approach might change the research landscape and the engineering culture dramatically, by the blending of disciplines (interdisciplinarity). The term 'technoscience' denotes the field where science and technology are inseparably interconnected, the trend goes from papers to patents, and the scientific 'search for truth' is increasingly replaced by search for applications with a potential economic value. Although the trend in many scientific fields goes towards applications for the market, a lot of disciplines will stick to the traditional Picture of science. An open question left to the future is whether the one development or the other (technoscience or pure science) is an advantage for the future of humans. in the subsequent section, the article gives information about organizations active in biomimetics. It shows the relevance of biomimetics on a global scale, and gives reasons for promoting transdisciplinary learning. Increasing interdisciplinarity calls for novel ways to educate the young.

Inga sessilis is self-incompatible and pollinated by hummingbirds, hawkmoths and bats. Fruit set under natural conditions is very low despite the fact that most stigmas receive polyads with sufficient pollen to fertilise all ovules in a flower. Nectar secretion starts in the bud stage and flowers continually secreting nectar for a period of 8h. Flowers actively reabsorbed the nectar a few hours before senescence. Sugar production increased after nectar removal, especially when flowers were drained during the night. Nectar sugar composition changed over flower life span, from sucrose-dominant (just after flower opening, when hummingbirds were the main visitors) to hexose-rich (throughout the night, when bats and hawkmoths were the main visitors).

In this context, bacterial dispersal is an essential aspect. Recent studies on the potential promotion of bacterial dispersal by fungal hyphae raised the idea of specifically applying fungal networks to accelerate bacterial degradation processes in situ. Our objective is to investigate these processes and their performance via simulation modelling and address the following questions: (1) Under what abiotic conditions can dispersal networks significantly improve bacterial degradation? and (2) To what extent does the spatial configuration of the networks influence the degradation performance? To answer these questions, we developed a spatially explicit bacterial colony model, which is applied to controlled laboratory experiments with Pseudomonas putida G7 organisms as a case study. Using this model, we analyzed degradation performance in response to different environmental scenarios and showed that conditions of limited bacterial dispersal also limit degradation performance. Under such conditions, dispersal networks have the highest potential for improving the bioavailability of pollutants to bacteria. We also found that degradation performance significantly varies with the spatial configuration of the dispersal networks applied and the time horizon over which performance is assessed. Regarding future practical applications, our results suggest that (1) fungal networks may dramatically improve initially adverse conditions for biodegradation of pollutants in soil, and (2) the network's spatial structure and accessibility are decisive for the success of such tasks.

Although it is often assumed that a persistent relationship exists between men's testosterone production and musculature, most studies either fail to find evidence for such a relationship, or document very weak associations. In nonhuman primates, by contrast, correlations between testosterone and muscle mass are higher. Here, we propose the Paternal Provisioning Hypothesis, which predicts that men's skeletal muscle is less dependent on the effects of androgens than that of other primates, and more sensitive to the physical demands of men's work. This permits human fathers to downregulate testosterone, which has negative impacts on pair-bonding and parenting effort, but without sacrificing the strength and musculature necessary to provision mates and offspring. METHODS: We tested predictions of the Paternal Provisioning Hypothesis by assessing parental status, salivary testosterone levels, anthropometry, and strength among 122 men (ages 18-78) at the Mogielica Human Ecology Study Site in rural Poland. We chose this population because men practice subsistence agriculture, regularly engaging in physically demanding labor. Grip and chest strength were assessed using a dynamometer, and upper-body musculature was estimated from arm muscle circumference. RESULTS: In this population, testosterone showed no association with measures of strength or musculature, and was lower in older men and pair-bonded fathers. Marital and parental status and workload, by contrast, were positive predictors of muscle mass and strength measures.

A common garden study with offspring from 51 populations from three regions and a broad range of land-use types and intensities showed that there was indeed systematic population differentiation of ecologically important plant traits in relation to land use, in particular due to increasing mowing and grazing intensities. We also found strong land-use-related genetic differentiation in plant phenology, where the onset of flowering consistently shifted away from the typical time of management.

In contrast, the beetle assemblages at the same sites showed the opposite pattern. We pursued an approach in the search for fungus-beetle associations by computing cross correlations and visualize significant links in a network graph.

To address these questions, we use a phylogenetic-based analyses of trait evolution in the subfamily Arinae (Neotropical parrots), focusing on habitat, nesting behavior, morphology, and life-history traits (clutch size, incubation period and fledging period). Evolutionary reconstructions show that transitions to excavating behavior mostly happened when species colonized open areas, providing evidence that this behavior originated in open environments.

Consequently, soils in HM-contaminated sites such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund sites are predicted to have altered ecosystem functioning, with potential ramifications for the health of organisms, including humans, that live nearby. Further, several studies have shown that heavy metal-resistant (HMR) bacteria often also display antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and therefore HM-contaminated soils could potentially act as reservoirs that could disseminate AMR genes into human-associated pathogenic bacteria. To explore this possibility, topsoil samples were collected from six public locations in the zip code 35207 (the home of the North Birmingham 35th Avenue Superfund Site) and in six public areas in the neighboring zip code, 35214. 35027 soils had significantly elevated levels of the HMs As, Mn, Pb, and Zn, and sequencing of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that elevated HM concentrations correlated with reduced microbial diversity and altered community structure. While there was no difference between zip codes in the proportion of total culturable HMR bacteria, bacterial isolates with HMR almost always also exhibited AMR. Metagenomes inferred using PICRUSt2 also predicted significantly higher mean relative frequencies in 35207 for several AMR genes related to both specific and broad-spectrum AMR phenotypes. Together, these results support the hypothesis that chronic HM pollution alters the soil bacterial community structure in ecologically meaningful ways and may also select for bacteria with increased potential to contribute to AMR in human disease.IMPORTANCE Heavy metals cross-select for antimicrobial resistance in laboratory experiments, but few studies have documented this effect in polluted soils.

Clear felling results in the loss of species and ecosystem services. The remaining woodland is used as a vital support system for the farming communities, and the impact of this utilisation on biodiversity and ecosystem service provision is not clear. Understanding these effects will aid the development of effective, sustainable land management strategies for multiple outcomes, including biodiversity conservation and resource utilisation. This study provides new data on miombo woodland tree species diversity, structure and carbon storage from a 8766 km(2) landscape in south-western Tanzania, which is undergoing rapid conversion to tobacco cultivation. Human utilisation of the woodland was classified by ground surveys which recorded evidence of use (e.g. cut poles and timber, removal of bark and roots, access routes). Nine sites were surveyed and categorised into three groups: high, medium and low utilisation. To determine the effect of utilisation on the tree community stem density, diameter at breast height, tree species richness and carbon storage were recorded. In the low utilisation sites carbon storage was similar to that found in other miombo woodlands (28 t Ha(-1)), and the Shannon Wiener diversity score for tree species diversity was 3.44. However, in the high utilisation sites, tree species diversity (2.86) and carbon storage declined (14.6 t Ha(-1)) In areas of moderate utilisation diversity and carbon storage were maintained, but the structure of the woodland was affected, with a reduction of Class 1 (Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) < 10 cm) stems, demonstrating low recruitment which leads to a reduction in sustainability. Tree species richness and abundance demonstrated an intermediate disturbance effect in relation to utilisation, with highest levels at medium utilisation sites. Key miombo woodland species from the subfamily Caesalpinioideae in the two genera Brachystegia and Julbernardia were present in all sites, but the frequency of Brachystegia species declined by 60% from low to high utilisation. The IUCN near-threatened timber species Pterocarpus angolensis, highly protected in Tanzania, was harvested throughout the study site, and the majority of trees recorded were immature (DBH <= 20 cm), suggesting that it is commercially extinct for the foreseeable future. These findings illustrate that in miombo woodlands with low to medium utilisation levels key miombo species are retained, and tree species diversity and carbon storage remains optimal. Sustainable land management plans need to regulate utilisation within miombo landscapes and retain areas of woodland. This will ensure their long term viability, and continue to support the 100 million people who are reliant on miombo woodlands for their goods and services. (C) 2015 The Authors.

However, little is known about the behavioural or physiological influence of water quality on wildlife health. East African savannas are well known for their migrating populations of ungulates coinciding with seasonal and spatial patterns of forage. In the Serengeti ecosystem, seasonal rainfall, high wildlife abundance and spatially variable soil composition result in temporal and spatial differences in surface water quality. Furthermore, nutrient enrichment from dissolved minerals and animal waste transported in runoff drive bacterial and algal blooms. Previous studies have suggested that water quality may be a factor in the migratory behaviour of wildebeest as poor quality water can have significant health consequences for ungulates, including depressed milk production and reduced food conversion. This paper examines the hypothesis that water quality in the southern Serengeti plains exceeds expected maximum tolerance limits at the end of the wet season - when migratory wildlife move northward, away from this region. Data collected during the migration's movement over 3years are examined to determine if regional differences in water quality are physiologically meaningful and how the consumption of poor quality water may influence wildebeest nutrient intake. With increased demand for surface water resources from human populations, growing climatic uncertainty and significant changes in land cover outside of protected areas, the influence of water quality on animal behaviour needs to be considered for future management strategies.

Pliocene marine records indicate that global climate was warmer and atmospheric pCO(2) was higher than pre-industrial conditions, spurring efforts to understand regional climate and environmental variability under conditions potentially analogous to future warming scenarios. In this study, we investigate sedimentary environments and paleoclimate conditions from the Meade Basin of southwest Kansas, a moderately sized basin formed from dissolution and withdrawal of deep evaporites. Pliocene intervals of the Meade Basin have yielded classic faunal assemblages representing the early to middle Blancan North American Land Mammal Age (similar to 4.5-3.2Ma). We reconstruct the paleoenvironments using a multidisciplinary approach of lithofacies analysis, paleopedology, and ichnology. The stratigraphic interval we examined is bounded by large-scale, fluvial trunk channels that show paleocurrent trends to the south-southwest-tangential to modern drainages-likely due to local halotectonic subsidence during the Neogene. The stratigraphic interval between these fluvially dominated phases consists of palustrine landscapes with temporally and laterally variable subaqueous and subaerial facies. Paleosols are abundant; however, most pedotypes are poorly to variably drained, and so their elemental compositions do not reflect local climate state. The few mature, oxidized, and relatively well-drained paleosols observed contain elemental signatures consistent with subhumid climate conditions. Frequent and recursive ponding events are discerned through the tiering of burrows (Camborygma isp.) similar to those produced by modern freshwater decapod crustaceans (i.e., crayfish). The drivers of these flooding events are most likely episodic halotectonic subsidence and groundwater discharge, though influence from intervals of relatively wetter climate cannot be ruled out. By the late middle Pliocene, landscapes returned to fluvially dominated environments as sedimentation began to outpace accommodation.

Here, we use global range maps, structural equation models (SEM), and comprehensive databases of dietary preferences and body masses of all terrestrial, non-volant mammals worldwide, to test whether (1) prey bottom-up or predator top-down relationships are important drivers of broad-scale species richness gradients once the environment and human influence have been accounted for, (2) predator-prey richness associations vary among biogeographic regions, and (3) body size influences large-scale covariation between predators and prey. SEMs including only productivity, climate, and human factors explained a high proportion of variance in prey richness (R-2 = 0.56) but considerably less in predator richness (R-2 = 0.13). Adding predator-to-prey or prey-topredator paths strongly increased the explained variance in both cases (prey R-2 = 0.79, predator R-2 = 0.57), suggesting that predator-prey interactions play an important role in driving global diversity gradients. Prey bottom-up effects prevailed over productivity, climate, and human influence to explain predator richness, whereas productivity and climate were more important than predator top-down effects for explaining prey richness, although predator top-down effects were still significant.

From the inspection of the PLS loadings matrices it was possible to elucidate that all drugs caused effects on protein and lipid levels. Most strikingly propranolol had significant effects on the lipid components of the cell. These were dramatically reduced possibly as a consequence of loss of membrane integrity. In order to investigate this further, FT-IR microspectroscopy was used to generate detailed metabolic fingerprinting maps. These chemical maps revealed that all the drugs had a dramatic effect on the distribution of various chemical species throughout the algae, and that all drugs had an affect on protein and lipid levels.

The dilution effect hypothesis, which points to decreases in biodiversity as critical to an increase in infection risk, has received considerable attention due to the allure of a win-win scenario for conservation and human well-being. Yet some empirical data suggest that the dilution effect is not a generalizable phenomenon. We explore the response of pathogen transmission dynamics to changes in biodiversity that are driven by habitat loss using an allometrically scaled multi-host model. With this model, we show that declining habitat, and thus declining biodiversity, can lead to either increasing or decreasing infectious-disease risk, measured as endemic prevalence. Whether larger habitats, and thus greater biodiversity, lead to a decrease (dilution effect) or increase (amplification effect) in infection prevalence depends upon the pathogen transmission mode and how host competence scales with body size. Dilution effects were detected for most frequency-transmitted pathogens and amplification effects were detected for density-dependent pathogens. Amplification effects were also observed over a particular range of habitat loss in frequency-dependent pathogens when we assumed that host competence was greatest in large-bodied species. By contrast, only amplification effects were observed for density-dependent pathogens; host competency only affected the magnitude of the effect. These models can be used to guide future empirical studies of biodiversity-disease relationships across gradients of habitat loss. The type of transmission, the relationship between host competence and community assembly, the identity of hosts contributing to transmission, and how transmission scales with area are essential factors to consider when elucidating the mechanisms driving disease risk in shrinking habitat.

Grass seeds contained more starch and less total phenols than did forb seeds and were free from alkaloids. The diet of the most graminivorous birds was correlated with seeds' starch concentration, while generalists' diet was correlated with seed abundance. To assess the plausible mechanisms underlying birds' selection of seed, we experimented with three species differing in the breadth of their diet: a generalist, the Rufous-collared Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), and two graminivores, the Many-colored Chaco-Finch (Saltatricula multicolor) and Common Diuca-Finch (Diuca diuca).

Assessing the functional diversity, which measures the range and value of ecological traits of organisms, can provide a more direct link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Therefore, as species responses to disturbances depend on their ecological traits, ecosystem functions are likely to be also imperiled by human perturbations. Although the literature on the effects of disturbances on functional diversity has been increasing, results are highly varied. Here, we provided the first comprehensive global meta-analysis on the effects of human disturbances on functional diversity of birds. We also performed subgroup analyses by region, habitat specialization, functional trait, functional diversity index and disturbance type. Our results indicate a consistent negative effect of disturbances on bird functional diversity, regardless of the variability caused by the different predictor variables considered. Specifically, we revealed that studies that were conducted in the tropics, focused on feeding traits and calculated functional diversity and richness indices presented negative responses to disturbances. Additionally, the functional diversity of birds, regardless of habitat specialization, was also negatively affected by anthropogenic disturbances. Lastly, habitat isolation, logging and urbanization exhibited a consistent negative effect on the functional diversity of birds, whereas agriculture, habitat loss and multiple disturbances had no detectable influence. These results indicate that anthropogenic disturbances can be detrimental to birds, possibly jeopardizing their ecological functions and threatening ecosystem resilience. We therefore suggest that conservation efforts should particularly focus on reducing or mitigating the effects of these three disturbances to at least diminish their effects on avian functional diversity.

The aim of this study was to explore Thai emergency nurses' management of patients with severe TBI. Methods: An exploratory descriptive mixed method design was used to conduct this two stage study: survey methods were used to examine emergency nurses' knowledge regarding management of patients with severe TBI (Stage 1) and observational methods were used to examine emergency nurses' clinical management of patients with severe TBI (Stage 2). The study setting was the emergency department (ED) at a regional hospital in Southern Thailand. Results: 34 nurses participated in Stage 1 (response rate 91.9%) and the number of correct responses ranged from 33.3% to 95.2%. In Stage 2, a total of 160 points of measurement were observed in 20 patients with severe TBI over 40 h. In this study there were five major areas identified for the improvement of care of patients with severe TBI: (i) end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) monitoring and targets; (ii) use of analgesia and sedation; (iii) patient positioning; (iv) frequency of nursing assessment; and (v) dose of Mannitol diuretic. Conclusions: There is variation in Thai nurses' knowledge and care practices for patients with severe TBI. To increase consistency of evidence-based TBI care in the Thai context, a knowledge translation intervention that is ecologically valid, appropriate to the Thai healthcare context and acceptable to the multidisciplinary care team is needed.

These functionally different partners, however, may also interact directly with one another in other ways, indirectly altering net outcomes and persistence of the mutualistic system as a whole. We present a population dynamical model of a three-species system involving antagonism between species sharing a mutualist partner species with two explicit life stages. We find that, regardless of whether the antagonism is predatory or non-consumptive, persistence of the shared mutualist is possible only under a restrictive set of conditions. As the rate of antagonism between the species sharing the mutualist increases, indirect rather than direct interactions increasingly determine species' densities and sometimes result in complex, oscillatory dynamics for all species. Surprisingly, persistence of the mutualistic system is particularly dependent upon the degree to which each of the two mutualistic interactions is specialized. Our work investigates a novel mechanism by which changing ecological conditions can lead to extinction of mutualist partners and provides testable predictions regarding the interactive roles of mutualism and antagonism in net outcomes for species' densities.

However, a critical and unresolved question for understanding the ecology of a community is to what extent these two levels of diversity are functionally substitutable? Here we show, for a mixed-species biofilm community composed of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. protegens and Klebsiella pneumoniae, that increased interspecific diversity reduces and functionally substitutes for intraspecific diversity in mediating tolerance to stress. Biofilm populations generated high percentages of genotypic variants, which were largely absent in biofilm communities. Biofilms with either high intra- or interspecific diversity were more tolerant to SDS stress than biofilms with no or low diversity. Unexpectedly, genotypic variants decreased the tolerance of biofilm communities when experimentally introduced into the communities. For example, substituting P. protegens wild type with its genotypic variant within biofilm communities decreased SDS tolerance by twofold, apparently due to perturbation of interspecific interactions. A decrease in variant frequency was also observed when biofilm populations were exposed to cell-free effluents from another species, suggesting that extracellular factors have a role in selection against the appearance of intraspecific variants. This work demonstrates the functional substitution of inter- and intraspecific diversity for an emergent property of biofilms.

The family Salamandridae, distributed across the entire Holarctic, is one of the most diverse groups of extant salamanders comprising 114 species in 21 genera. The family has a remarkable diversity of courtship modes, amplexus and sperm transfer. It is often hypothesised that this diversity has evolved in adaptation to a specific mating and/ or breeding habitat. We test this hypothesis based upon a phylogenetic reconstruction using the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of 45 Salamandridae species, representing all existing genera. We used ancestral character state reconstruction methods and geographic range models and applied relaxed Bayesian molecular clock models to discuss the results in a temporal framework of Salamandridae evolution. Our results show that the family Salamandridae started to diversify in the Late Cretaceous (ca. 87 mya) and is of Western Palearctic origin. Ancestral character state reconstruction predicts that its common ancestor was oviparous, mated on land without amplexus and probably showed a pin wheel spermatophore transfer, which is still found in the Italian endemic Salamandrina terdigidata. Our results suggest that several colonization of continents with subsequent radiations took place, once to the Nearctic and twice into Eastern Asian realms. However, these events were only in one case associated with a change in mating behaviour (dorsal amplexus in Nearctic newts). Around the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (K-Pg boundary) several Salamandridae lineages further diverged, again with no obvious changes in mating behaviour. Overall, there is no significant signal for mating character evolution being caused by changes in habitat type, with only a slight tendency that changes in mating habitat might have led to changes in the type of sperm transfer which in turn was associated with changes in the presence or absence of amplexus.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hochkirch, Axel/A-4092-2008","Hochkirch, Axel/0000-0002-4475-0394",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1055-7903","1095-9513",NA,NA,NA,"APR",2018,121,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"98","109",NA,"10.1016/j.ympev.2018.01.006","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2018.01.006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29330138,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000426200800010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Feeding analyses indicated that some species groups shared similar diets. Likewise, patterns of morphological variation based on geometric morphometrics demonstrated that some taxa did not differ in body shape, while patterns of variation in other species were seen in body length and height, caudal peduncle height and the anal fin anterior insertion point. A multivariate association between diet composition data and overall body shape indicated significant ecomorphological relationships, describing a continuum between species displaying benthopelagic morphology and specializing on prey with high speed swimming ability (Engraulidae), versus species with benthic morphology and specializing on fast escape prey (crustacea).

Female mammals may exhibit phenotypical masculinization due to exposure to androgens during early development, a condition that is associated with maternal performance during subsequent breeding. Our goal was to assess whether female composition (in terms of masculinization) of plurally breeding groups influences female fitness in a natural population of degus (Octodon degus). We assessed if plurally breeding female degus assort themselves by anogenital distance (AGD), an accurate measure of masculinization level. We also quantified if homophily by AGD phenotype affects female reproductive success and the reproductive output of the group. Plurally breeding groups typically included similarly masculinized (i.e., long AGD) females or similarly feminized (short AGD) females, indicating a strong degree of homophily. Females weaned more offspring in plurally breeding groups with more masculinized females. Additionally, standardized variance in the number of offspring weaned decreased in plurally breeding groups with mostly masculinized females, indicating greater reproductive equality in these groups.

Genetic variation of organisms in complex landscapes, seascapes, or riverine systems, however, may be shaped by many forces. Recent research has linked habitat heterogeneity and landscape or seascape configuration to genetic structure by integrating methods from landscape ecology, population genetics, and spatial statistics in approaches known as landscape or seascape genetics. However, functional differences between terrestrial or seascapes systems in comparison to riverscape topography (i.e., movement pathways for aquatic obligate species are constrained to river channels) make translating these approaches into freshwater analyses problematic. Studies that may be described as riverscape genetics (RG) have linked temperature, stream gradient, and confluences to genetic variability. Lack of consistency in methodology, however, has made comparisons across species and scales difficult. We provide a perspective on how RG could be used to provide a more comprehensive conceptual and applied understanding of connectivity and dispersal in freshwater systems. We describe four thematic areas of study representing current and future research opportunities and describe a basic workflow for conducting RG analysis. Although numerous methodological challenges remain, a RG approach can enhance our understanding of habitat heterogeneity in shaping gene flow and spatial genetic structure.

Factors such as population growth and urban development, a shift from resource-based to service-based economies, and intensification in the livestock industry change the extent and practice of grazing worldwide. We investigated how and why livestock grazing on public lands changed since 1940 in the High Divide region of the Northern Rocky Mountains through a detailed analysis of United States Forest Service (USFS) rangeland management records. Based on a 90-year land use history, we process-traced the proximate causes of changes in grazing, identified the decision makers, and statistically tested which underlying factors were associated with changes in grazing. The forage annually consumed by livestock in our study area declined by 62% since 1940, the equivalent of about 33,000 fewer cows grazing on public lands for a three-month summer period. Livestock grazing was closed on 21% of the total allotment area. The reductions in grazing were mainly caused by land management and policy factors: evaluations of range condition (27%), carrying capacity estimates (21%) and legal and administrative requirements (14%) derived from the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA). The socio-economic causes of ranch economics (14%) and amenity migration (8%) were comparatively small.

Currently, it possesses a cosmopolitan distribution across the semi-arid agro-ecologies of Africa and its cultivation has extended to other regions, particularly in the drier parts of Asia and Indonesia. Due to historic neglect, research on the crop and policy prioritization in national breeding programs is lagging; hence, varietal development is in its infancy. Farmers rely on traditional landraces, which are characterized by low productivity and yield. Breeding for moisture stress adaptation and high yield is crucial to improve its productivity and adequate genetic diversity is desired to strengthen resiliency for climate adaptation and nutritional and food security. Nevertheless, thousands of plant genetic resources (PGRs) conserved in several genebanks are still not being fully utilized to reintroduce lost diversity into farmers' fields and pre-breeding activities. The exploitation of ex situ conserved PGRs has been minimal due to a lack of extensive genetic characterization. Thus, to harness utilization of the PGRs in genetic improvement programs, holistic strategies including the traditional genomic resources and participatory-led trait discoveries are needed to bridge the gap between conservation and utilization of ex situ germplasm.

Similarly, students in a mathematics programme, interested in biological phenomena, find it difficult to master the complex systems encountered in biology. In short, the biologists do not have enough mathematics and the mathematicians are not being taught enough biology. The need for interdisciplinary curricula that includes disciplines such as biology, physical science, and mathematics is widely recognized, but has not been widely implemented. In this paper, it is suggested that students develop a skill set of ecology, mathematics and technology to encourage working across disciplinary boundaries. To illustrate such a skill set, a predator-prey model that contains self-limiting factors for both predator and prey is suggested. The general idea of dynamics, is introduced and students are encouraged to discover the applicability of this approach to more complex biological systems.

Our survey data, collected through pre-assessment (2011) and mid-assessment (2013) evaluation surveys of project participants, measured participants' attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs regarding transdisciplinary research. Paired samples t-tests were employed to compare measures from the same individuals at two points in time. The key variables were transdisciplinary attitudes, transdisciplinary behaviors, satisfaction with collaboration, perceived impacts of collaboration, and trust and respect. Changes over time were evaluated for the overall project team and by project role subgrouping that included principal investigators, professional and technical staff, graduate students, advisory board members, and extension educators. The analysis examined the following research questions: (1) Do participants' attitudes and behaviors toward the transdisciplinary process change over the course of the project? (2) Do these changes vary by participant role? Results indicate that while transdisciplinary behaviors did not significantly change for most of the role subgroups, advisory board members showed a decrease in transdisciplinary behaviors from the pre-assessment to the mid-assessment evaluation. Analysis of the other measures consistently showed a positive increase in mean scores from the pre- to the mid-assessment with one exception. Graduate student scores on the transdisciplinary attitude scale decreased over time. Understanding how participant perceptions may change over the course of a project and how project roles may influence these changes is important to managing effective long-term transdisciplinary projects.

In contrast with previous generations, forestry students today must be prepared to handle the impacts of climate change and increasing fire severity and frequency, as well as critical human dimensions, including the need to collaborate with Native American nations. To explore the extent to which social and fire science is taught in forestry programs and how it has changed over time, we conducted a content analysis of prominent forestry course textbooks used in graduate programs in the United States. We found little change between texts published before and after 2000, except for an increase in discussion of climate change. Of the currently used textbooks, we found a significant variation in whether they included discussion of traditional ecological knowledge, prescribed burning, combined economic factors, logging, and whether they recommended prescribed burning and logging. Given that not all programs offer or require courses that specialize in these topics, many forestry students may be missing relevant interdisciplinary social-fire education that is necessary to handle contemporary and changing forestry issues.

Their frequency and intensity are affected by historical and contemporary land management practices, climate change, and forest use change-factors that are all influenced by social, political, and economic processes. However, our findings, based on an analysis of the contents of prominent textbooks used in US forestry courses, along with other research, show that the connections between fire and socioecological factors are often neglected in forestry higher-education textbooks. This suggests that future forest managers may not be properly prepared to handle changing fire regimes as climate change advances and social, political, and economic forces influence forestry practices. Thus, our research suggests that required forestry curricula course content should be revised to incorporate more coverage of fire science and socioecological factors, particularly traditional ecological knowledge and climate change, to prepare future foresters for the emerging challenges they will face.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"York, Richard/R-1565-2017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0022-1201","1938-3746",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2021,119,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"236","250",NA,"10.1093/jofore/fvaa062","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jofore/fvaa062",NA,"FEB 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000654656500003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In Ukraine, the ecological direction acquires national features and many Ukrainian manufacturers associate this mainly with ecologically clean materials: this is most typical for furniture products and traditional construction made of wood. The proposed technique is an effective tool for analyzing the interaction of environmental and design disciplines at different levels, as well as an effective criterion for evaluating methods of structuring educational material. The introduction of the correlation index makes assessing the effectiveness of the application of environmental knowledge in design possible.FindingsThe analysis of the world ecological design experience makes presenting the Ukrainian experience of environmental design possible, the origins of which date back to the 1920s of the 20th century. In terms of the purpose and methods of education, the authors consider art and industrial schools to be the primary basis of design education in Ukraine. In the 1990s of the 20th century, on the material and technical bases, educational-methodical and staffing with experienced teachers that design departments are formed, which train and graduate certified designers in various specializations. The need for readiness to solve the tasks of environmental education of future designers in the context of end-to-end environmental training is an urgent problem. Relying on ecological concepts makes optimally structuring the educational material possible, taking into account the requirements for both environmental and professional training.Research limitations/implicationsStudies have established that the application of the authors' method of continuous environmental education has a positive effect on the assimilation of environmental knowledge and method's use in professional theory. Increasing the rates of assimilation and application of environmental knowledge by students has a positive effect on the interaction of environmental and professional knowledge.Practical implicationsThe practical significance of the project consists in the implementation of the development of design projects on specific topics, including competitive, diploma and master's theses. The presented examples of designer shaping from wastes are expressive examples to follow in educational design, important for the development of students' creative and ecological thinking. The methodology is tested in several institutions of higher education in Ukraine, and the authors hope that this can spread in other countries, in particular in the training of designers specializing in Furniture Design.Social implicationsEcodesign is gradually being established in the general structure of design theory and, accordingly, has the right to an independent role in the formation of new principles of shaping the spatial and object environment of human life.Originality/valueNew approaches require new educational standards, curricula and teaching methods, directed in particular to the development of a systemic interdisciplinary approach.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Prusak, Yurii/GLQ-9900-2022; Prusak, Volodymyr/JJC-4717-2023; Savka, Iryna/AAX-8866-2020; Prokopchuk, Inna/AAA-4366-2021","Prusak, Yurii/0000-0003-3349-4468; Savka, Iryna/0000-0002-3213-0921; Prokopchuk, Inna/0000-0001-9353-2169",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2042-3896","2042-390X",NA,NA,NA,"NOV 8",2023,13,"6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1073","1091",NA,"10.1108/HESWBL-11-2022-0232","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/HESWBL-11-2022-0232",NA,"APR 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000974345800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The overwhelming majority of these studies stop short of fully embracing qualitative methodologies. The lack of integrative social and natural science data for a topic such as soil carbon farming is problematic as theoretical carbon sequestration opportunities identified through soil mapping and process-based models can fail to deliver the sequestration levels promised when introduced on-the-ground. Such mapping needs to account for the human factors involved in delivering increased soil carbon on-farm. Here, we develop a mixed methods mapping approach to explore the potential for increasing soil carbon stocks on upland farms in the UK. Our approach considers ecological and social complexity through application of soil science, ecology, participant observation, interviews and a focus group. Our maps revealed landscapes that are full of carbon farming opportunity, but contain previously hidden barriers to the delivery of increased soil carbon. For example, they revealed that carbon farming can be considered by farmers to work in opposition to perceived 'good farming' practices and be correlated with increased incidents of livestock disease. We also discovered that the use of maps in research can be problematic as they can close down discussion and exclude local representation of an area. Trialling an interdisciplinary mixed methods approach produced new, deeper and more richly-textured understandings about how soil carbon management is produced socially as well as ecologically on upland livestock farms. Our findings have potential to improve the success of future carbon farming initiatives by incorporating farmer knowledge and social drivers of implementation.

The most important requirements were to achieve a lap time of below 2 min 45 s on the Circuit de la Sarthe, and to have a durability, efficiency, cornering speed, and acceleration that exceeds Formula 1 race cars. Data provided from InMotion included design restrictions, a simplified drive cycle, and technical data of some components. This data was analyzed and the required powertrain component sizes were determined. A detailed drive cycle calculation and sensitivity analysis were introduced to find the variables that significantly influence the lap time. The powertrain was modeled using the backwards approach and an energy management strategy was designed with the objective of minimizing fuel consumption. Finally, five different powertrain configurations were presented, and several tradeoffs between lap time and different parameters were discussed. The results showed that the fastest achievable lap time using the proposed configurations was 3 min 9 s.

The sustainability of city systems therefore depends upon complex, cross-scale interactions between the natural system, the transboundary engineered infrastructures, and the multiple social actors and institutions that govern these infrastructures. These elements, we argue, are best studied in an integrated manner using a novel social-ecological-infrastructural systems (SEIS) framework. In the biophysical subsystem, the SEIS framework integrates urban metabolism with life cycle assessment to articulate transboundary infrastructure supply chain water, energy, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprints of cities. These infrastructure footprints make visible multiple resources (water, energy, materials) used directly or indirectly (embodied) to support human activities in cities. They inform cross-scale and cross-infrastructure sector strategies for mitigating environmental pollution, public health risks and supply chain risks posed to cities. In the social subsystem, multiple theories drawn from the social sciences explore interactions between three actor categories-individual resource users, infrastructure designers and operators, and policy actors-who interact with each other and with infrastructures to shape cities toward sustainability outcomes. Linking of the two subsystems occurs by integrating concepts, theories, laws, and models across environmental sciences/climatology, infrastructure engineering, industrial ecology, architecture, urban planning, behavioral sciences, public health, and public affairs. Such integration identifies high-impact leverage points in the urban SEIS.

Teaching aims include training students to be capable of proposing and implementing solutions to ecological problems associated with changing modes of consumption. To achieve an effective HESC, five pedagogical principles seem essential in training students to deal with real-life complex problems and develop solutions to them: basing the pedagogical approach on a human ecology training, considering the production consumption system as a whole; dealing with uncertainty, encouraging collaborative learning from the diversity of students; and addressing the issue of complexity by an interdisciplinary approach.

The number of publications, not their content, has long been the most important index of scientific competence, and the pursuit of high publication rates has greatly affected how we teach, conduct research, and engage in the process of knowledge transfer. It is time to move away from publication metrics and embrace a more holistic assessment to remain relevant and deliver on societal needs. Extensive field experience is required to understand the limitations of different methods, study designs, and data collection. Unfortunately, publications based on fieldwork are declining, whereas those based on modelling and data analyses are increasing. The focus on publication rates and pressure to complete degrees within stipulated time has made fieldwork-based studies nearly impossible. We firmly believe that this is a dangerous development, and we argue for increased attention to fieldwork and empirical training. Students should enter the environments in which they are studying, collect and analyse real data, and apply ecological inference. We see a risk that research questions become restricted by the way research projects and PhD projects are organised, often one researcher - one project, typically funded for three years.

A bibliometric analysis is conducted on 591 wetland park studies indexed in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. The study utilizes CiteSpace and VOSviewer tools to visualize and explore influential research focuses, themes, directions, and countries. The citation burst indicates that from 1996 to 2022, research on wetland parks transited from exploring basic community structures to complex ecosystem service assessments and the formulation of management strategies. Furthermore, over the past three years, wetland park research has seen a significant surge in studies investigating water quality, ecosystem services, and spatiotemporal analysis. Notably, the three most frequent keywords in research on wetland parks were China, South Africa, and biodiversity. These keywords reflect regions that enhance biodiversity via wetland parks. The spectral-clustering algorithm identifies carbon sequestration as a research focus, highlighting the vital role of wetlands in the carbon cycle. Most authors work in developed countries' institutions, but some are from developing countries like China, South Africa, and India. The findings suggest that economic development is crucial in wetland park construction and significantly influences related research. Developed countries may offer more PhD positions to developing countries' researchers in the field and raise their awareness about wetland conservation. Given the holistic requirements of wetlands, this research recommends that educators should adopt an interdisciplinary approach in the future when nurturing wetland staff. Additionally, the study maps out the primary areas of interest in wetland park research, including environmental science, ecological economics, forestry, wetlands, tourism, and management.

Developing effective strategies to deal with IAS requires a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach, in which scientists work co-operatively with social scientists and policy-makers. Higher education can contribute to this process by training professionals to balance the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of the IAS problem. We examined the extent of such training in Canada by reviewing undergraduate and graduate university curricula at all 94 member institutions of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada for IAS content. We found that degree and diploma programs focusing on IAS issues are lacking at Canadian post-secondary institutions. Furthermore, few courses are devoted solely to 1AS, and those that are typically adopt an ecological perspective.

They inhabit extremely variable freshwater environments in Africa and South America, have a short lifespan and a set of unique and fascinating developmental characteristics. Embryos survive within the dry substrate during the dry season, whereas the adult population dies. Thus, the survival of the populations is entirely dependent on the buried embryos that hatch the next rainy season. Although Old and New World species share similarities in their life cycle, they also have different adaptive responses associated with climate-related selective pressures. Therefore, contrasting different species from these areas is essential to understand unique adaptations to heterogeneous environment.

It investigates whether existing service paradigms are best suited to future digital delivery of services in the emergent network society. Design/methodology/approach - It uses an interpretive methodological approach creating a body of phenomenological evidence enabling comparison between the organisational context, internal practices, histories and policies of collecting institutions, and the wider socio-technical impact of the internet. Literature reviews provide evidence from the outer world of internet developments and impact to establish four generic drivers of internet change. For the inner world of collecting institutions, organisational context and research and development on innovation are examined to analyse various perspectives on common approaches to service policy and practice. Additionally, textual analysis of institutional mission statements and policy documents is used to establish the degree of common purpose across collecting institutions and the preparedness of practitioners and policymakers to deal with rapid socio-technical change. Findings - The evidence is synthesised to define an institutional paradigm describing the present operational processes and practices of collecting institutions. This is compared with the four generic drivers to define opportunities and challenges that collecting institutions face in exploiting the internet. This synthesis demonstrates that the siloised and fragmented nature of the institutional paradigm creates significant barriers to effective exploitation. Evidence from the textual analysis is used to develop a shared mission statement for all collecting institutions as the foundation of a strategic digital future.

Despite a key role in regulating the Earth system, terrestrial ecology has historically been underrepresented in the Earth system models (ESMs) that are used to understand and project global environmental change. Ecology and Earth system modeling must be integrated for scientists to fully comprehend the role of ecological systems in driving and responding to global change. Ecological insights can improve ESM realism and reduce process uncertainty, while ESMs offer ecologists an opportunity to broadly test ecological theory and increase the impact of their work by scaling concepts through time and space. Despite this mutualism, meaningfully integrating the two remains a persistent challenge, in part because of logistical obstacles in translating processes into mathematical formulas and identifying ways to integrate new theories and code into large, complex model structures. To help overcome this interdisciplinary challenge, we present a framework consisting of a series of interconnected stages for integrating a new ecological process or insight into an ESM. First, we highlight the multiple ways that ecological observations and modeling iteratively strengthen one another, dispelling the illusion that the ecologist's role ends with initial provision of data. Second, we show that many valuable insights, products, and theoretical developments are produced through sustained interdisciplinary collaborations between empiricists and modelers, regardless of eventual inclusion of a process in an ESM.

The annual Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED) at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences has begun to address this gap. MMED offers participants exposure to a broad range of concepts and techniques from both epidemiological traditions. During MMED 2010 we developed a pedagogical approach that bridges the traditional distinction between classical and dynamical epidemiology and can be used at multiple educational levels, from high school to graduate level courses. The approach is hands-on, consisting of a real-time simulation of a stochastic outbreak in course participants, including realistic data reporting, followed by a variety of mathematical and statistical analyses, stemming from both epidemiological traditions. During the exercise, dynamical epidemiologists developed empirical skills such as study design and learned concepts of bias while classical epidemiologists were trained in systems thinking and began to understand epidemics as dynamic nonlinear processes. We believe this type of integrated educational tool will prove extremely valuable in the training of future infectious disease epidemiologists. We also believe that such interdisciplinary training will be critical for local capacity building in analytical epidemiology as Africa continues to produce new cohorts of well-trained mathematicians, statisticians, and scientists.

Finally, we quantified these drivers as spatial covariates and evaluated their value as predictors in three models: 1) logistic regression of cannabis land use distribution post legalization (2016); 2) logistic regression of cannabis development from pre- to post-legalization (2013/2014 to 2016); and 3) linear regression of existing farm plant count change from pre- to post-legalization. We assessed the relationship of covariates with the model output and contextualized their patterns using the interview data. We found that most of the interview-derived covariates were significantly associated with cannabis distribution and development, including parcel size, human footprint, distance to nearest cannabis farm, density of local cannabis production, clearable land cover, farm zoning, elevation, roughness, and distance to rivers. These results provide useful insights into the dynamics of a rapid land use change frontier in a formalizing sector, as well as its potential environmental repercussions. The contextualized understanding of cannabis land use drivers may serve to mitigate environmental harm or predict changes occurring in other rural cannabis systems.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Parker-Shames, Phoebe/0000-0002-1738-0471; Bodwitch, Hekia/0000-0002-0187-2682",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0169-2046","1872-6062",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2023,237,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"104783","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2023.104783","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2023.104783",NA,"MAY 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001007560300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Traditional approaches aiming to compartmentalize a phenomenon within the confines of a single discipline and failing to engage non-science partners are outmoded and cannot identify solutions that have traction in the social, economic, and political arenas in which conservation actions must operate. As a result, conservation science teams must adopt multiple disciplinary approaches that bridge not only academic disciplines but also the political and social realms and engage relevant partners. Five reasons are presented that outline why conservation problems demand multiple disciplinary approaches in order to move forward because: (i) socio-ecological systems are complex, (ii) multiple perspectives are better than one, (iii) the results of research must influence practice, (iv) the heterogeneity of scale necessitates it, and (v) conservation involves compromise. Presenting reasons that support multiple disciplinarity demands a review of the barriers that impede this process, as we are far from attaining a model or framework that is applicable in all contexts. Two challenges that impede multiple disciplinarity are discussed, in addition to pragmatic solutions that conservation scientists and practitioners can adopt in their work.

We summarize an interdisciplinary investigation aimed at identifying the drivers of green area loss, green cover loss, and quantifying the impact on three inner-ring suburban neighborhoods located along the Rio Piedras watershed in San Juan, Puerto Rico. An inductive approach to social-ecological research was undertaken because it provides a flexible platform for interdisciplinary collaboration on this complex and dynamic subject. The three developments selected for the study were constructed in the mid-20th century under paradigms of modernity that included providing conditions for a better and more dignified way of living, among which green areas played a central role. The green area change analysis was undertaken first, by way of using building footprint growth as a proxy, which represents a minimal estimate of change, and transferring the information from aerial photographs, original development plans, construction drawings, and GIS maps to AutoCAD to quantify building footprint change for each neighborhood. The period of analysis started from the time of the construction of each development to the year 2010. The second estimation was performed using orthorectified infrared aerial imagery to quantify green cover in year 2008 and contrast that information with the conditions at the time the developments were constructed. Green-gray area dynamics were thus analyzed together with longitudinal socioeconomic data to help in the assessment of effects. The investigation revealed long-term socioeconomic declining trends in two of the neighborhoods, weak governance of the built environment, substantial increase in automobile ownership, and distinct physical-spatial characteristics as drivers behind the changes observed. The complexity and variety of exogenous and endogenous factors that have been identified in this study as affecting private and public inner-ring suburban green areas reveals dynamic and spatially differentiated concomitant processes and suggests that these are conditioned by the socioeconomic trajectories of each neighborhood and by larger metropolitan scale socioeconomic and technological trends. Lower income neighborhoods reflect a tendency for socioeconomic decline and greater loss of green areas and vegetation cover in time, thus suggesting policies geared toward adaptive governance. In contrast, the upper income neighborhood exhibits a more stable socioeconomic trajectory and less significant green area loss as well as increase in vegetation cover. Three hypotheses are posited for future sampling increments and testing. The findings and literature on urban economics and the decline of inner-ring suburbs in the U. S. suggest the need for policy geared to sustainable urban redevelopment as a strategy for adaptive governance. The competing needs for land by higher density uses and by green areas in sustainable redevelopment initiatives requires a trade-off analysis in which a thorough account of costs and benefits is warranted.

Urban and suburban development has been spreading across the relatively flat terrain, resulting in the destruction of an acre of desert land per hour every hour of every day. Consequently, desert land preservation within the expanding city limits has become an issue of great concern. Beginning in 1993 with a citizen's advisory group, a multi-governmental and interdisciplinary collaboration in preservation planning has been growing in an effort to keep pace with urban and suburban expansion. This article follows the evolution of preservation planning in Phoenix as a case study with particular consideration given to how landscape ecological principles have been integrated into an existing land planning structure. The case study examines (1) historic desert land preservation planning efforts, beginning with the establishment of South Mountain Park in 1925, at 16,500 acres (6677 ha) now the largest municipal park in the nation; (2) more recent preservation planning efforts including a 1995 interdisciplinary charrette focused on desert preservation and alternative forms of urban, suburban, and rural development in Phoenix; (3) ecological inventories and analyses that have influenced the desert land preservation planning process; (4) the development and implementation of the Sonoran Preserve Master Plan, the plan for a 21,500 acre (8701 ha) desert preserve in the north Phoenix area (NPA).

It compared the decomposition of stillborn piglets (Sus scrofa domesticus), as human analogues, to oak (Quercus robur) leaf litter and soil-only controls outdoors for 720 days. Environmental and edaphic parameters were monitored and showed soil microbial community alignment with temperature seasonality, which highlighted the importance of this abiotic factor. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) data were used to calculate Hill numbers and diversity indices of the bacterial 16S rRNA community did not distinguish mammalian- from plant-based decomposition consistently during the first or second year of the study. In contrast, the fungal 18S rRNA community allowed clear differentiation between different treatments (beta diversity) throughout the 720-day experiment and suggested the moment of the decomposing mammalian skin rupture. 16S rRNA-based NGS facilitated the identification of e.g., Pirellulaceae, Acidobacteria ii1-15_order and Candidatus xiphinematobacter as Year 2 bacterial markers of gravesoil at family, order and species taxonomic levels, respectively, and confirmed the similarity of the calculated Hill diversity metrics with those derived from DGGE profiling. Parallel soil elemental composition was measured by portable X-ray Fluorescence where calcium profiles for the piglet-associated soils were distinct from those without carrion. Also, soil calcium content and PMI correlated positively during the first year then negatively during the second. This study is one of the first to apply a multidisciplinary approach based on molecular and physicochemical analytical techniques to assess decomposition. It highlights the recognised potential of using soil microbial community in forensic investigations and provides a proof-of-concept for the application of a combined molecular and elemental approach to further understand the dynamics of decomposition.

The classification evidence obtained from single metrics and quality elements, on the One-out, All-out principle, which establishes status according to the weakest measure, was compared with the integrated classification system used in the Finnish national status assessments. The national classification system harmonizes the individual measures by scoring and expresses overall Status class as a median score across quality elements. In addition, because the amount of reference data for this lake type was limited, palaeolimnological analyses were conducted to determine lake-specific changes during past decades. The results demonstrated that individual metrics and quality elements may result in highly variable classifications, and consequently pessimistic ecological estimates, if the One-out, All-out principle is applied.

This review describes the feeding ecology of the shrimps in coastal lagoon-estuarine systems, with emphasis on the following: the effect of the environment on the shrimps' natural food; techniques for identification of items in shrimps gut contents and stable isotope compositions; consideration of the importance of plants and small animals in the diet; and the effect of mangroves and lagoon-estuarine system on feed ecology. The abundance of penaeid appears to be primarily affected by stochastic variations in environmental factors. However, it has been found that the relationships between macroinfauna, macrofauna and environmental conditions in a tropical estuary may result in more interactions with their predators than a direct response to physical-chemical factors. The combination of the study of shrimps guts contents and stable isotopes shows a composition and seasonal variation in the diets, as well as the source of carbon and nitrogen contained in the shrimp's tissues.

Under natural conditions, these microbes share their habitat with a similarly dynamic community of eukaryotes (helminths, protozoa, and fungi), many of which are well-known parasites. Both parasites and the prokaryotic microbiota can dramatically alter the physical and immune landscape of the gut, creating ample opportunities for them to interact. Such interactions may critically alter infection outcomes and affect overall host health and disease. For instance, parasite infection can change how a host interacts with its bacterial flora, either driving or protecting against dysbiosis and inflammatory disease. Conversely, the microbiota can alter a parasite's colonization success, replication, and virulence, shifting it along the parasitism-mutualism spectrum. The mechanisms and consequences of these interactions are just starting to be elucidated in an emergent transdisciplinary area at the boundary of microbiology and parasitology. However, heterogeneity in experimental designs, host and parasite species, and a largely phenomenological and taxonomic approach to synthesizing the literature have meant that common themes across studies remain elusive. Here, we use an ecological perspective to review the literature on interactions between the prokaryotic microbiota and eukaryotic parasites in the vertebrate gut.

The accumulation of La in the leaf cells was positively correlated with the intensity of endocytosis, while the intensity of endocytosis was negatively correlated with the density of leaf trichomes.

Cultural hierarchies of knowledge and the hegemony of the natural sciences create a barrier to interdisciplinary understandings. Here, we review three different projects that confront this difficulty, integrating biological and ethnographic methods to study conservation problems. The first project involved wildlife foraging on crops around a newly established national park in Gabon. Biological methods revealed the extent of crop loss, the species responsible, and an effect of field isolation, while ethnography revealed institutional and social vulnerability to foraging wildlife.

The local ecological knowledge (LEK) of fishers can be an alternative to advance understanding about fish trophic interactions and to construct aquatic food webs, especially in regions lacking research capacity. The objectives of this study are: to calculate the trophic levels of six fish species important to fishing by combining data from stable isotopes analysis and fishers' LEK in two clear water rivers (Tapajos and Tocantins) in the Brazilian Amazon; to compare the trophic levels of these fish between the two methods (stable isotopes analysis and LEK) and the two rivers; and to develop diagrams representing the trophic webs of the main fish prey and predators based on fisher's LEK.

A total of 98 interviews and 63 samples for stable isotopes analysis were carried out in both rivers. The average fish trophic levels did not differ between the stable isotopes analysis and the LEK in the Tapajos, nor in the Tocantins Rivers.

While there is currently a high-profile emphasis on landscape conservation and maintenance of wildlife mobility in East Africa, pastoralist herding range fragmentation is less often considered within conservation planning or assessments of ecological change. To address this, we asked, how have institutional changes interacted with the alignment of livestock husbandry livelihoods and ecological dynamics? We identified institutional changes that formed due to state intervention during the colonial and post-independence eras, and recent changes that have occurred due to privatized wildlife conservation. We then used ethnographic methods to analyze how these changes have interacted with biophysical conditions and herder agency to shape current livelihoods. We found that recent barriers to seasonal range access have occurred due to policies on private conservation ranches, conflicts between pastoralists in surrounding areas, and recent conservation interventions. While pastoralist households have adapted their livelihood strategies within these constraints on mobility, livelihoods have also been impacted by complex interactions with markets, changes in herding institutions, relations with conservation actors, ecological conditions of currently accessed sites, and biophysical factors related to livestock species. Bringing together political ecology and social-ecological systems literatures, we conclude that efforts to align institutions and ecological processes in favor of wildlife conservation overlook the current institutional and ecological basis of livelihoods and, in so doing, perpetuate a historically-rooted scalar mismatch between pastoralist livestock mobility and ecological variability.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Nelson, Donald/C-3225-2014; German, Laura/AAM-9934-2020; Unks, Ryan/HME-2058-2023","Unks, Ryan/0000-0002-8216-7570",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0016-7185","1872-9398",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2019,99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"74","87",NA,"10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.12.010","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.12.010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000460711600008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Romanian Village Development is a topic of great interest, both theoretical and especially practical for various fields - social, economic, political etc. Once Romania joins the European Union, the countryside has undergone major changes and has seen a special dynamic, thanks to the many challenges imposed by some European standards which have created new prospects for development, but also brought new problems.

In the early diagnosis method of PBC, anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) are an important diagnostic basis, especially the M2 subtype (AMA-M2) with almost 100% specificity. We selected the BCOADC-E2 protein, a mitochondrial autoantigen that reacts specifically with AMA-M2 antibodies, and carried out DNA recombination and protein mutation experiments by cloning in vitro the homologous target gene sequence BCKD that expresses the antigenic epitope of BCOADC-E2 protein, to provide experience for later exploring the effect of mutations of amino acids around the lysine in the active center of BCOADC-E2 protein on its specific binding to AMA-M2, and to lay the foundation for determining the key amino acids of BCOADC-E2 for the diagnosis and treatment of PBC.

To gain a deeper understanding of the use and application of animal social network analysis, we systematically surveyed the literature and extracted information on publication trends from articles using social network analysis. We synthesize trends in social network research over time and highlight variation in the use of different aspects of social network analysis. The use of social network analysis in empirical articles has increased over time. In the context of social network methods, we found that many studies did not use an association index to account for missing individuals or observations of individuals; that the number and type of social network metrics calculated in a given study varied substantially (median = 2); and that focal observation was by far the most common method used to generate social networks, although the use of biologging devices increased over time. We also observed that most species studied using social networks are mammals (55%) or birds (23%), and that the majority are species of least concern (59%; International Union for the Conservation of Nature, IUCN, www.iucn.org). Based on our findings, we highlight four key recommendations for future studies: (1) the use of association indices is almost always necessary; (2) the a priori selection of specific network metrics and associated hypotheses increases transparency; (3) combination of focal observation with biologging devices could improve our understanding of remotely sensed behaviours; and (4) because most studies rarely study species of conservation concern, it may be practical to generate networks for similar species or populations, which could help inform management decisions. We highlight emerging trends in social network research that may be valuable for distinct groups of social network researchers: students new to social network analysis, experienced behavioural ecologists interested in using social network analysis and advanced social network users interested in trends of social network research. Our findings also shed light on past research and provide guidance for future studies using social network analysis. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However, the heterogeneity of data and the superposition of spatial and temporal variability, intrinsic to a drift campaign, complicate the interpretation of observations. In this study, we have compiled a qualitycontrolled physical hydrographic dataset with best spatio-temporal coverage and derived core parameters, including the mixed layer depth, heat fluxes over key layers, and friction velocity. We provide a comprehensive and accessible overview of the ocean conditions encountered along the MOSAiC drift, discuss their interdisciplinary implications, and compare common ocean climatologies to these new data. Our results indicate that, for the most part, ocean variability was dominated by regional rather than seasonal signals, carrying potentially strong implications for ocean biogeochemistry, ecology, sea ice, and even atmospheric conditions. Near-surface ocean properties were strongly influenced by the relative position of sampling, within or outside the river-water influenced Transpolar Drift, and seasonal warming and meltwater input.

Here we identify thirteen practical strategies that ECRs can employ to become more relevant. In this context, relevance'' refers to the ability to contribute to solving conservation problems through engagement with practitioners, policy makers, and stakeholders. Conservation and career strategies outlined in this article include the following: thinking 'big picture' during conservation projects; embracing various forms of knowledge; maintaining positive relationships with locals familiar with the conservation issue; accepting failure as a viable (and potentially valuable) outcome; daring to be creative; embracing citizen science; incorporating interdisciplinarity; promoting and practicing pro-environmental behaviours; understanding financial aspects of conservation; forming collaboration from the onset of a project; accepting the limits of technology; ongoing and effective networking; and finally, maintaining a positive outlook by focusing on and sharing conservation success stories. These strategies move beyond the generic and highlight the importance of continuing to have an open mind throughout the entire conservation process, from establishing one's self as an asset to embracing collaboration and interdisciplinary work, and striving to push for professional and personal connections that strengthen personal career objectives.

Drawing upon infrastructure studies, relational theories of coproduction of knowledge and social life, and advances within restoration ecology and dam removal science, we present a preliminary framework of dams as systems with irreducibly interrelated political, financial, environmental, social, and technological dimensions (PFESTS). With this framework we analyse three dam removals occurring over a similar time period and within the same narrow geographic region (the Mid-Columbia Region in WA and OR, USA) to demonstrate how each PFESTS dimension contributed to the decision to remove the dam, how it affected the process of removing the dam, and how those dimensions continue to operate post removal in each watershed.

Asa consequence, plastic pollution has become one of the most prolific fields of research in research areas including chemistry, physics, oceanography, biology, ecology, ecotoxicology, molecular biology, sociology, economy, conservation, management, and even politics. In this context, one may legitimately expect plastic pollution research to be highly interdisciplinary. However, using the emerging topic of microplastic and nanoplastic leachate (i.e., the desorption of molecules that are adsorbed onto the surface of a polymer and/or absorbed into the polymer matrix in the absence of plastic ingestion) in the ocean as a case study, we argue that this is still far from being the case. Instead, we highlight that plastic pollution research rather seems to remain structured in mostly isolated monodisciplinary studies. A plethora of analytical methods arc now available to qualify and quantify plastic monomers, polymers and the related additives. We nevertheless show though a survey of the literature that most studies addressing the effects of leachates on marine organisms essentially still lack of a quantitative assessment of the chemical nature and content of both plastic items and their leachates. In the context of the ever-increasing research effort devoted to assess the biological and ecological effects of plastic waste, we subsequently argue that the lack of a true interdisciplinary approach is likely to hamper the development of this research field.

Infection risk for any single species is determined, in part, by the distribution of its obligate intermediate host snail. As the World Health Organization reprioritizes snail control to reduce the global burden of schistosomiasis, there is renewed importance in knowing when and where to target those efforts, which could vary by schistosome species. This study estimates factors associated with schistosomiasis risk in 16 villages located in the Senegal River Basin, a region hyperendemic for Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni. We first analyzed the spatial distributions of the two schistosomes' intermediate host snails (Bulinus spp. and Biomphalaria pfeifferi, respectively) at village water access sites. Then, we separately evaluated the relationships between human S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections and (i) the area of remotely-sensed snail habitat across spatial extents ranging from 1 to 120 m from shorelines, and (ii) water access site size and shape characteristics. We compared the influence of snail habitat across spatial extents because, while snail sampling is traditionally done near shorelines, we hypothesized that snails further from shore also contribute to infection risk. We found that, controlling for demographic variables, human risk for S. haematobium infection was positively correlated with snail habitat when snail habitat was measured over a much greater radius from shore (45 m to 120 m) than usual. S. haematobium risk was also associated with large, open water access sites. However, S. mansoni infection risk was associated with small, sheltered water access sites, and was not positively correlated with snail habitat at any spatial sampling radius.

We use population viability models to test if a hypothetical WNS treatment or management action could facilitate the recovery of WNS-affected little brown myotis Myotis lucifugus populations. We modelled scenarios altering three parameters: (a) WNS severity (population growth rate of WNS-affected populations; lambda(WNS)); (b) proportion of population treated; and (c) treatment improvement in winter survival (TIWS). Our models predict that a treatment or management action that targets an entire population with a TIWS of 40% (the average TIWS in bat trials to date) will cause a population to stabilize or increase if WNS causes an annual decline of less than 70% (i.e. lambda(WNS) > 0.30). However, for severe WNS (lambda(WNS) = 0.10), the TIWS must be at least 54% to cause a population to stabilize or increase. Where only a proportion of a WNS-affected population is treated, population stability is much harder to achieve unless the impact of WNS attenuates over time. Our models suggest that a treatment or management action only facilitates the recovery of WNS-affected populations if WNS is mild, TIWS is high, and a large proportion of the population can be treated. If a small proportion of the population is treated, it is easier to facilitate recovery if WNS severity attenuates over time. Synthesis and applications.

The corpus within the literature can provide expert-level annotations for images, and the visual information within images naturally serves as a clustering center for the textual corpus. However, both image data and literature represent large and rapidly growing, unstructured datasets of heterogeneous modalities. To address this challenge, we propose cross-modal embedding clustering, a method that parameterizes these datasets using a deep learning model with relatively few annotated samples. This approach offers a means to retrieve relevant factual information and expert knowledge from the database of images and literature through a question-answering mechanism. Specifically, we align images and literature across modalities using a pair of encoders, followed by cross-modal information fusion, and feed these data into an autoregressive generative language model for question-answering with user feedback. Experiments demonstrate that this cross-modal clustering method enhances the performance of image recognition, cross-modal retrieval, and cross-modal question-answering models. Our method achieves superior performance on standardized tasks in public datasets for image recognition, cross-modal retrieval, and cross-modal question-answering, notably achieving a 21.94% improvement in performance on the cross-modal question-answering task of the ScienceQA dataset, thereby validating the efficacy of our approach. Essentially, our method targets cross-modal information fusion, combining perspectives from multiple tasks and utilizing cross-modal representation clustering of images and text. This approach effectively addresses the interdisciplinary complexity of forestry ecology literature and the parameterization of unstructured heterogeneous data encapsulating species diversity in conservation images.

Although a set of good practices about what constitutes a good SES study are emerging, there is still a disconnection between generating SES scientific studies and providing decisionrelevant information to policy makers. Classical single variable/hypothesis studies rooted in one or two disciplines are still most common, leading to incremental growth in knowledge about the natural or social system, but rarely both. The recognition of human dimensions is a key aspect of successful planning and implementation in natural resource management, ecosystem-based management, fisheries management, and marine conservation. The lack of social data relating to human-nature interactions in this particular context is now seen as an omission, which can often erode the efficacy of any resource management or conservation action. There have been repeated calls for a transdisciplinary approach to complex SESs that incorporates resilience, complexity science characterized by intricate feedback interactions, emergent processes, non-linear dynamics and uncertainty. To achieve this vision, we need to embrace diverse research methodologies that incorporate ecology, sociology, anthropology, political science, economics and other disciplines that are anchored in empirical data. We conclude that to make SES research most useful in adding practical value to conservation planning, marine resource management planning processes and implementation, and the integration of resilience thinking into adaptation strategies, more research is needed on (1) understanding social-ecological landscapes and seascapes and patterns that would ensure planning process legitimacy, (2) costs of transformation (financial, social, environmental) to a stable resilient social-ecological system, (3) overcoming place-based data collection challenges as well as modeling challenges.

However, under certain conditions, small changes in gene drive fitness could lead to divergent outcomes in spreading behavior. In the face of ecological uncertainty, the inability to estimate gene drive fitness in a real-world context could prove problematic because gene drives designed to be localized could spread to fixation in neighboring populations if ecological conditions unexpectedly favor the gene drive.

This is not surprising since polar regions are largely only accessible by means of expensive modern infrastructure and instrumentation. In 1999, the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz-Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) established the LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) observatory HAUSGARTEN crossing the Fram Strait at about 79 degrees N. Multidisciplinary investigations covering all parts of the open-ocean ecosystem are carried out at a total of 21 permanent sampling sites in water depths ranging between 250 and 5500 m. From the outset, repeated sampling in the water column and at the deep seafloor during regular expeditions in summer months was complemented by continuous year-round sampling and sensing using autonomous instruments in anchored devices (i.e., moorings and free-falling systems). The central HAUSGARTEN station at 2500 m water depth in the eastern Fram Strait serves as an experimental area for unique biological in situ experiments at the seafloor, simulating various scenarios in changing environmental settings. Long-term ecological research at the HAUSGARTEN observatory revealed a number of interesting temporal trends in numerous biological variables from the pelagic system to the deep seafloor. Contrary to common intuition, the entire ecosystem responded exceptionally fast to environmental changes in the upper water column. Major variations were associated with a Warm-Water-Anomaly evident in surface waters in eastern parts of the Fram Strait between 2005 and 2008. However, even after 15 years of intense time-series work at HAUSGARTEN, we cannot yet predict with complete certainty whether these trends indicate lasting alterations due to anthropologically-induced global environmental changes of the system, or whether they reflect natural variability on multiyear time-scales, for example, in relation to decadal oscillatory atmospheric processes.

However, management applications remain limited in part because we lack measurements linking ecosystem characteristics (ecosystem structure and processes) to final ecosystem services. Policymakers need marginal values, changes in final ecosystem services (direct link to human welfare) relative to additional units of ecosystem characteristics ( increment final ecosystem services/ increment ecosystem characteristics) to assess tradeoffs. Progress, however, has been slow due to confusion on ecological production functions (EPFs) in ecology. Here, we apply a new interdisciplinary approach to craft EPFs to evaluate four ecosystem services using the Yongding River Green Ecological Corridor as our case study. The Yongding Corridor is Beijing's largest, most expensive green infrastructure project (similar to $2.5 billion USD), constructed as a network of seven artificial lakes and wetlands. The Beijing Government wants the Yongding Corridor to improve four ecosystem services: (1) water storage, (2) local climate regulation, (3) water purification, and (4) aesthetics. We first worked with stakeholders to determine final ecosystem service levels and then used the Variable Infiltration Capacity model to estimate key ecosystem processes from the designed lakes and wetlands. We coupled the modeling with ecological field data and social surveys to create EPFs. We evaluated the ecosystem services by calculating shortfalls and then determined synergies and tradeoffs to identify actions for reducing shortfalls. We found the Yongding Corridor is meeting desired levels for aesthetics, but incurred shortfalls on the remaining services. To obtain the desired services, we recommend managers: (1) maintain inflow rates and/or make the lakes deeper to reduce water loss rates; (2) improve water quality-wetlands have high nutrient retention, but nutrient loads must be reduced; and (3) plant shade trees since evaporative cooling from the lakes and wetlands is having no measurable impact on human comfort. Results indicate the absence of ecosystem functions in landscape design led to shortfalls, but solutions require coupling green and built infrastructure to obtain multi-functionality.

Previous studies on tool site selection have addressed the relevance of targeted resources and raw materials for tools, but few have considered the broader foraging landscape. In this landscape-scale study of the ecological contexts of wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) tool use, we investigated the conditions required for nut-cracking to occur and persist in discrete locations at the long-term field site of Bossou, Guinea. We examined this at three levels: selection, frequency of use, and inactivity. We collected data on plant foods, nut trees, and raw materials using transect and quadrat methods, and conducted forest-wide surveys to map the location of nests and watercourses. We analysed data at the quadrat level (n = 82) using generalised linear models and descriptive statistics. We found that, further to the presence of a nut tree and availability of raw materials, abundance of food-providing trees as well as proximity to nest sites were significant predictors of nut-cracking occurrence. This suggests that the spatial distribution of nut-cracking sites is mediated by the broader behavioural landscape and is influenced by non-extractive foraging of perennial resources and non-foraging activities. Additionally, the number of functional tools was greater at sites with higher nut-cracking frequency, and was negatively correlated with site inactivity. Our research indicates that the technological landscape of Bossou chimpanzees shares affinities with the 'favoured places' model of hominin site formation, providing a comparative framework for reconstructing landscape-scale patterns of ancient human behaviour.

We undertook two case studies on the influence of oil and gas activities within neighbouring federal districts in the tundra zone. Employing a strongly interdisciplinary approach, we studied the ecological, spatial and social dimensions of the visible and perceived changes in land use and land cover. Our data are derived from field sampling, remote sensing and intensive participant observation with indigenous Nenets reindeer herders and non-indigenous workers. Important trends include the rapid expansion of infrastructure, a large influx of workers who compete for freshwater fish, and extensive transformation from shrub- to grass- and sedge-dominated tundra. The latter represents an alternative ecosystem state that is likely to persist indefinitely. On terrain disturbed by off-road vehicle traffic, reindeer pastures' vegetation regenerates with fewer species among which grasses and sedges dominate, thus reducing biodiversity. To have maximum forage value such pastures must be accessible and free of trash, petro-chemicals and feral dogs. We found that a wide range of direct and indirect impacts, both ecological and social, accumulate in space and time such that the combined influence is effectively regional rather than local, depending in part on the placement of facilities. While incoming workers commonly commit poaching, they also serve as exchange partners, making barter for goods possible in remote locations. In general, the same positive and negative impacts of the presence of industry were mentioned in each study region. Even using very high-resolution remote sensing data (Quickbird-2) it is not possible to determine fully the amount of degraded territory in modern oil and gas fields.

Expert knowledge can provide additional valuable information regarding ecological or historical attributes of species, but the influence of integrating this information in the modeling process has been poorly explored. Here, we integrated expert knowledge in different stages of the niche modeling process to improve the representation of the actual geographic distributions of Mexican primates (Ateles geoffroyi, Alouatta pigra, and A. palliata mexicana). We designed an elicitation process to acquire information from experts and such information was integrated by an iterative process that consisted of reviews of input data by experts, production of ecological niche models (ENMs), and evaluation of model outputs to provide feedback. We built ENMs using the maximum entropy algorithm along with a dataset of occurrence records gathered from a public source and records provided by the experts. Models without expert knowledge were also built for comparison, and both models, with and without expert knowledge, were evaluated using four validation metrics that provide a measure of accuracy for presence-absence predictions (specificity, sensitivity, kappa, true skill statistic). Integrating expert knowledge to build ENMs produced better results for potential distributions than models without expert knowledge, but a much greater improvement in the transition from potential to realized geographic distributions by reducing overprediction, resulting in better representations of the actual geographic distributions of species. Furthermore, with the combination of niche models and expert knowledge we were able to identify an area of sympatry between A. palliata mexicana and A. pigra.

The project focuses on Mongue, a location in southern Mozambique located on a promontory at the end of the peninsula in Inhambane bay. We intervene on Mongue not only for its specific prerogatives, but also because it is considered as an exemplary point of transcalar application of a methodological proposal of analytical and design intervention of a more general nature, which can bring to the attention some general objectives that are considered important for Mozambique as a whole. The title Mo.N.G.U.E. is also an acronym for Mozambique, Nature, Growth, University, Education, which are the themes addressed by the research project: the theme of nature, environment and landscape, associated in Mozambique with a condition of both fragility and potential, addressed locally with the Municipal Ecological Park project; the theme of growth, understood as qualitative development; the university as the engine of the country's economic and civil development, expressed through the project of a research center dedicated to environmental issues linked to the Pedagogical University of Maxixe; widespread education that today also extends to childhood, with the project of a nursery school for the Mongue community. The results of the research project were not only made possible thanks to a transcalar approach, concerning an analysis of the African and Mozambican, as well as local context, but also were founded on multidisciplinary assumptions, thanks to which it was possible to define different project levels in order to arrive at a common goal. The collaboration of the architectural, urban, territorial and landscape field - together with conservation of historical buildings and existing heritage issues, technical structural and bioclimatic topics, environmental and energy sustainability, economic enhancement and financial sustainability, management and maintenance of buildings - has provided the research project with an added value of general interest: the possibility, through an operational synthesis that overcomes the distinctions of separate approaches, to consider the complexity that affects, at all scales, not only the specific case examined, but in general all the spaces of our living. Through the transcalar and multidisciplinary approach, it was possible to define a broad territorial and local knowledge framework and a project masterplan which, with the aim of pursuing real sustainability at the methodological level, was based on the basic themes of architecture making the relationship with the soil, climatic conditions, available resources.

In the last decade, tumor genomics has contributed to the improvement of our understanding of tumorigenesis and has led to the identification of numerous cellular targets for the development of novel therapies. However, since tumors are by nature extremely heterogeneous, the drug efficacy and economical sustainability of this approach is now debatable.

Our findings highlight several areas restoration businesses must navigate. First, restoration businesses must juggle potentially competing goals, maintaining ecological integrity while achieving profitability objectives. Second, these businesses must manage the risk that arises from variability in the natural environment as well as individuals' risk tolerances. Third, they must navigate the disconnect between science and practice, including how to best monitor restoration projects. Fourth, they must make decisions about new techniques and innovations. Fifth, on-the-ground implementation must acknowledge that personnels' motives and expertise might conflict with original plans. We discuss these findings in relation to relevant scholarly research, offering implications for theory and practice. For example, the business of ecological restoration requires learning over time to be profitable while achieving the desired ecological and social outcomes; restoration businesses leverage monitoring in pursuit of adaptive management and engage frontline personnel as important voices in the restoration process.

We conducted a global systematic literature review to evaluate biogeographic, taxonomic and ecological research biases in the urban ecology of reptiles and ultimately to detect major gaps and steer future sampling efforts. Our database comprised 278 articles dealing with biological responses to urbanisation of 493 species across 45 countries, comprising 658 cases between a given species and specific biological response. Research on the urban ecology of reptiles was geographically and taxonomically biased. Developed countries within temperate regions were better sampled, whereas developing tropical and megadiverse countries were mostly undersampled or neglected. Among reptile orders, Testudines and Crocodylia were proportionally more studied than Squamata. Across lower groups within Squamata, lizards were present in most studies and were the biological model most commonly used. Studies evaluating biological responses associated with landscape-level processes, behaviour and/or population dynamics were prevalent, whereas conservation, human-reptile conflicts and wildlife management were the least considered topics. Our results show that research on urban ecology of reptiles is unevenly distributed across regions and lineages. Overcoming these major gaps is an important step towards the improvement of the conservation of reptiles worldwide under the upcoming biodiversity loss scenario.

In particular, the characterization of foraging patterns is crucial to understand and foresee the evolution of dynamics between sharks and their prey. Many shark species use the mesopelagic area as a major foraging ground but the degree to which different pelagic sharks rely on this habitat remains overlooked. In order to depict the vertical dimension of their trophic ecology, we used mercury stable isotopes in the muscle of three pelagic shark species (the blue shark Prionace glauca, the shortfin mako shark Isurus oxyrinchus and the smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena) from the northeastern Pacific region. The Delta Hg-199 values, ranging from 1.40 to 2.13 parts per thousand in sharks, suggested a diet mostly based on mesopelagic prey in oceanic habitats. We additionally used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) alone or in combination with Delta Hg-199 values, to assess resource partitioning between the three shark species. Adding Delta Hg-199 resulted in a decrease in trophic overlap estimates compared to those based on delta C-13/delta N-15 alone, demonstrating that multi-isotope modeling is needed for accurate trophic description of the three species. Mainly, it reveals that they forage at different average depths and that resource partitioning is mostly expressed through the vertical dimension within pelagic shark assemblages. Concomitantly, muscle total mercury concentration (THg) differed between species and increased with feeding depth. Overall, this study highlights the key role of the mesopelagic zone for shark species foraging among important depth gradients and reports new ecological information on trophic competition using mercury isotopes. It also suggests that foraging depth may play a pivotal role in the differences between muscle THg from co-occurring high trophic level shark species. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyzed diet similarities to define trophic components (nodes) - rather than taxonomical groups - in the network. We evaluated the ecological function of species or trophic entities through topological analysis of their structural importance in trophic networks by applying one local and several mesoscale network indices. We found that top predatory elasmobranchs play an important ecological role in top-down control and in propagating indirect effects through the system owing to high values of the node degree, centrality and topological importance indices.

Results from our study thus suggest that elasmobranchs at intermediate trophic levels - commonly referred to as mesopredators - are not so important in all complex coastal ecosystems as previously reported.

Traditionally designed to bridge ecology and economy through economic language and logic (e.g., goods and services), this conceptual framework has developed into an effective tool for interdisciplinary work. The concept of ecosystem services is used to improve the management of ecosystems for human well-being. However, gaps in how to govern ecological benefits remain. Specifically, identifying which stakeholders benefit the most from the provision of ecosystem services remains largely unaddressed. This study examines the spatial discordance between ecosystem services and the residential stakeholders who may benefit. Using a landscape approach to quantify urban ecosystem services, an area-based composite index was developed for the City of Toronto, Canada, based on the three pillars of sustainability in order to identify potentially vulnerable populations. This method combines the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial multicriteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) to combine and weight a select grouping of socioeconomic and ecological indicators. In addition, two sets of enumeration units (i.e., dissemination areas and census tracts) were evaluated to assess the potential impact of measurement scale on subsequent decision or policy outcomes. Results indicate the spatial interdependencies between ecological and socioeconomic processes in an urban setting, offering a unique framework for novel planning and policy intervention strategies.

This has led to a pressing need for improved biophysical and causal understanding of Phytoplankton Functional Type (PFT) optical signals, in order for satellite radiometry to be used to detect ecologically relevant phytoplankton assemblage changes. Biophysically and biogeochemically consistent phytoplankton Inherent Optical Property (TOP) models play an important role in achieving this understanding, as the optical effects of phytoplankton assemblage changes can be examined systematically in relation to the bulk optical water-leaving signal. The Equivalent Algal Populations (EAP) model is used here to investigate the source and magnitude of size- and pigment-driven PFT signals in the water-leaving reflectance, as well as the potential to detect these using satellite radiometry. This model places emphasis on the determination of biophysically consistent phytoplankton IOPs, with both absorption and scattering determined by mathematically cogent relationships to the particle complex refractive indices. All IOPs are integrated over an entire size distribution. A distinctive attribute is the model's comprehensive handling of the spectral and angular character of phytoplankton scattering. Selected case studies and sensitivity analyses reveal that phytoplankton spectral scattering is most useful and the least ambiguous driver of the PFT signal. Key findings are that there is the most sensitivity in phytoplankton backscatter (b(b phi)) in the 1-6 mu m size range; the backscattering-driven signal in the 520 to 570 nm region is the critical PFT identifier at marginal biomass, and that, while PFT information does appear at blue wavelengths, absorption-driven signals are compromised by ambiguity due to biomass and non-algal absorption. Low signal in the red, due primarily to absorption by water, inhibits PFT detection here. The study highlights the need to quantitatively understand the constraints imposed by phytoplankton biomass and the IOP budget on the assemblage-related signal. A proportional phytoplankton contribution of approximately 40% to the total b(b) appears to a reasonable minimum threshold in terms of yielding a detectable optical change in R-rs.

We conducted a socio-ecological questionnaire-based survey on government and non-government organizations directly involved in coastal plantation efforts in three 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami affected states in mainland India.

One site was invaded by a grass (Microstegium vimineum), another by a shrub (Rhamnus davurica), and the third by a tree (Ailanthus altissima).

Though root-zone microbial community structure initially differed across locations, plant invasion shifted communities in similar ways. Indicator species analysis revealed that Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) closely related to Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Ascomycota increased in abundance due to plant invasions. The Hyphomonadaceae family in the Rhodobacterales order and ammonia-oxidizing Nitrospirae phylum showed greater relative abundance in the invaded root-zone soils. Hyphomicrobiaceae, another bacterial family within the phyla Proteobacteria increased as a result of plant invasion, but the effect associated most strongly with root-zones of M. vimineum and R. davurica.

In agreement with phylogenetic and functional analyses, greater turnover of ammonium and nitrate was associated with plant invasion.

India has one of the highest elasmobranch landings globally, through both targeted catch and bycatch. As elasmobranchs contribute to food and livelihood security, there is a need for holistic approaches to bycatch mitigation. We adopt an interdisciplinary approach to critically assess a range of hypothetical measures for reducing elasmobranch capture in a trawler fishery on India's west coast, using a risk-based mitigation hierarchy framework. Data were collected through landing surveys, interviews and a literature review, to assess the following potential management options for their technical effectiveness and socio-economic feasibility: (1) spatio-temporal closures; (2) net restrictions; (3) bycatch reduction devices (BRDs); and (4) live onboard release. Our study provides the first evidence-based and nuanced understanding of elasmobranch bycatch management for this fishery, and suggestions for future conservation and research efforts. Onboard release may be viable for species like guitarfish, with moderate chances of survival, and was the favored option among interview respondents due to minimal impact on earnings. While closures, net restrictions and BRDs may reduce elasmobranch capture, implementation will be challenging under present circumstances due to the potentially high impact on fisher income. Interventions for live release can therefore be used as a step toward ameliorating bycatch, while initiating longer-term engagement with the fishing community. Participatory monitoring can help address critical knowledge gaps in elasmobranch ecology. Spatio-temporal closures and gear restriction measures may then be developed through a bottom-up approach in the long term. Overall, the framework facilitated a holistic assessment of bycatch management to guide decision-making.

We carried out a range-wide analysis of climatic requirements, morphological and genetic variation across southeast Africa to test the hypothesis that the extent of gene flow among populations of the brown scrub-robin are influenced by their distinct climatic niches. We recovered two distinct trends depending on whether our analyses were hierarchically structured at the subspecies or at the within subspecies level. Between subspecies we found pronounced morphological differentiation associated with strong reproductive isolation (no gene flow) between populations occupying divergent climatic niches characterized by changes in the temperature of the warmest and wettest month. In contrast, within subspecies, we recovered continuous morphological variation with extensive gene flow among populations inhabiting the temperate and sub-tropical forests of southern Africa, despite divergence along the climate axis that is mainly determined by minimum temperature and precipitation of the coldest months.

Despite the essential need for such interdisciplinary interactions, little research has examined the impact of scientific team support measures like training, facilitation, team building, and expertise. The literature is clear that solving complex problems requires more than contributory expertise, expertise required to contribute to a field or discipline. It also requires interactional expertise, socialised knowledge that includes socialisation into the practices of an expert group. These forms of expertise are often tacit and therefore difficult to access, and studies about how they are intertwined are nearly non-existent. Most of the published work in this area utilises archival data analysis, not individual team behaviour and assessment. This study addresses the call of numerous studies to use mixed-methods and social network analysis to investigate scientific team formation and success. This longitudinal case-based study evaluates the following question: How are scientific productivity, advice, and mentoring networks intertwined on a successful interdisciplinary scientific team? This study used applied social network surveys, participant observation, focus groups, interviews, and historical social network data to assess this specific team and assessed processes and practices to train new scientists over a 15-year period. Four major implications arose from our analysis: (1) interactional expertise and contributory expertise are intertwined in the process of scientific discovery; (2) team size and interdisciplinary knowledge effectively and efficiently train early career scientists; (3) integration of teaching/training, research/discovery, and extension/engagement enhances outcomes; and, (4) interdisciplinary scientific progress benefits significantly when interpersonal relationships among scientists from diverse disciplines are formed.

Geomorphological understanding is central to environmental flows because it is the interaction between flow, form, and substrate that influences habitat type, condition, availability and biotic use across space and time. This relationship varies longitudinally, laterally, vertically, overtime, and across macro- to mesoscale morphologies within the riverine environment. The geomorphic template is, therefore, as integral as the flow. We reviewed studies where field evidence indicated that geomorphology impacts the effectiveness of environmental flow strategies and we make the case for the need to increase geomorphic considerations in environmental flows. Although flow is commonly referred to as the master variable in environmental flows, geomorphology mediates the effects of flow regime on ecological processes. Concepts and applications from this perspective on the role of geomorphology in riverine ecosystem research will inform the practice, policy, and implementation of environmental flows.

The lack of a clear definition of sustainable fashion is often given as a major reason behind fashion's increasing unsustainability. Taking a social-ecological system perspective, augmented by a feminist critical realist understanding of being (ontology) and knowledge of being (epistemology), I examine the past two decades of academic literature mentioning the concept sustainable fashion. I find a definition is indeed lacking in various academic discourses and approaches related to sustainable fashion. This lack is problematic because it means the fashion industry can talk preposterously without making useful progress on decreasing its negative impacts on people and the living planet. However, the ever-changing patterns and contexts of fashion would soon outdate a single fixed definition. What is presented as a two-sided problem - whether or not to define sustainable fashion - is instead a problematique. Sustainable fashion is better understood as an unsolvable predicament in a complex dynamic intertwined social-ecological system. While no solution exists, there are appropriate reflexive responses. These start by using a critical systems approach that includes fashion's social (non-material) and ecological (material) aspects. A social-ecological system approach prevents businesses from exploiting the slipperiness of inconsistent definitions, aids policymaking by providing context and structure for the many contributory concepts (e.g., slow, green, or circular fashion), and fosters vital transdisciplinary research on sustainable fashion.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Palm, Celinda/0000-0003-3590-0466",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1548-7733",NA,NA,NA,"DEC 8",2023,19,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2261342","10.1080/15487733.2023.2261342","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2023.2261342",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001075502200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Separation in both breeding islands and foraging grounds are generally considered to be the conditions for prezygotic isolation. However, it is unclear how both can be maintained in a context of ongoing distributional range shifts due to global change, with range contractions and expansions caused by changing land use in breeding territories and oceanographic conditions impacting productivity areas. In this context, we expect that wherever the fragile balance of allopatric segregation breaks down, gene flow may be re-established across the borders of what is currently considered separated species. In these melting pot areas, fine-scale ecological differentiation is likely the only force opposing panmixia in otherwise highly similar organisms. In this study, we focus on six Polynesian Pterodroma species currently found on Motu Nui, a protected islet offshore of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), four of which have likely extended their breeding range to that island recently. To understand the fine-scale interaction between these closely-related species in their new contact zone, we used an integrative approach combining ecological and genetic methods, including morphometric, bioacoustics, stable isotope niche reconstruction, breeding site characterisation, phenology traits, and both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers. We found that significant amounts of gene flow occur across what is currently considered species boundaries, sometimes questioning the relevance of the accepted species classification. Interestingly, our results indicate that multivariate ecological distance between individuals in a group of closely related species (P. alba, P. atrata, P. heraldica, and P. neglecta) is a relevant predictor of gene flow intensity, while more distant species such as P. ultima and P. nigripennis seem to maintain reproductive isolation. Thus, the case of Pterodroma petrels supports the idea that incomplete allopatric speciation processes may be halted or even reversed on a secondary contact zone.

In this study, we assessed the public acceptance of a restoration project in a coastal wetland of Costa Brava (Spain). We combined the ES framework with a cultural approach, which is capable of considering interdisciplinarity, introducing barely assessed services like tranquility and facilitating further integration of the human dimension in the ES framework. We administered an open-ended questionnaire to 232 visitors and the answers were submitted to a content analysis to get a post hoc classification of services and values.

Just as for competition, distinguishing different modes of facilitation (mutualistic, commensal or even antagonistic) may be crucial. We therefore introduce the new concept of symmetric versus asymmetric facilitation and present a generic individual-based zone-of-influence model. The model simultaneously implements different modes of both facilitation and competition among individual plants via their overlapping zone of influence. Because we consider facilitation modes as a continuum related to environmental context, we integrated this concept with the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) by exploring differences in spatial pattern formation in self-thinning plants along a stress gradient in our model. The interplay among modes of interaction creates distinctly varied spatial patterns along stress gradients. When competition was symmetric, symmetric facilitation (mutualism) consistently led to plant aggregation along stress gradients. However, asymmetric facilitation (commensalism) produces plant aggregation only under more benign conditions but tends to intensify local competition and spatial segregation when conditions are harsh. When competition was completely asymmetric, different modes of facilitation contributed little to spatial aggregation. Symmetric facilitation significantly increased survival at the severe end of the stress gradient, which supports the claim of the SGH that facilitation should have generally positive net effects on plants under high stress levels. Asymmetric facilitation, however, was found to increase survival only under intermediate stress conditions, which contradicts the current predictions of the SGH. Synthesis. Our modelling study demonstrates that the interplay between modes of facilitation and competition affects different aspects of plant populations and communities, implying context-dependent outcomes and consequences. The explicit consideration of the modes and mechanisms of interactions (both facilitation and competition) and the nature of stress factors will help to extend the framework of the SGH and foster research on facilitation in plant ecology.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Berger, Uta/0000-0001-6920-136X; Lin, Yue/0000-0002-0346-6493",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0022-0477","1365-2745",NA,NA,NA,"NOV",2012,100,"6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1482","1491",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.02019.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.02019.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000310336500020","View Full Record in Web of Science"

By contrast, stress through interspecific competition or predation reduces intraspecific competition and thereby delays microevolution.

Non-selective predation through harvesting and interspecific competition with Daphnia magna delayed the selection for individuals carrying the ace-1(R) resistance allele. Under non-toxic conditions, susceptible individuals without ace-1(R) prevailed. Likewise, predation delayed the reverse adaptation of the populations to a non-toxic environment, while the effect of interspecific competition was not significant.

Despite the broad scope of the indicators, individual studies were found to often lack interdisciplinarity and a systemic view on agroecosystems. Besides, not only were there few studies that included the impacts of diversification on input use, socio-economic sustainability and resilience capacity, but specific biodiversity attributes (e.g. functional diversity, landscape diversity) and ecosystem services (e.g. soil biological quality, water regulation, pollination) were generally underreported. The impact of diversification was more positive than negative in all dimensions of sustainability, with the exception of crop productivity. Yet, diversified systems are associated with reduced costs and high yields can still be achieved in diversified systems with appropriate agricultural management (e.g. adequate number and type of shade trees).

Unfortunately, the fishery distribution have been changing due to anthropogenic climate change (CC). In this sense, this study analyses were directed to predict the suitability and distribution of red octopus (Octopus maya), an endemic and commercially important species of the Yucatan Peninsula (YP) in Mexico under different CC scenarios. For this purpose, a correlative (CNM) and mechanistic (MNM) niche models based on temperature and salinity and on metabolic scope, respectively, were projected to different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 6, 8.5) for the 2040-2050 and 2090-2100 periods. The CNM results suggest that red octopus suitability and potential distribution (PD) could be slightly reduced for the RCP 2.6 scenario. Whereas, RCP 4.5 shows higher suitabilities at the northern region of the YP, which is characterized by a seasonal upwelling which could act as climate refugia. In contrast, a significant suitability and PD reduction occurs during 2090-2100 for the RCP 6 and 8.5 scenarios. On the other hand, MNM indicates the red octopus could retain most of its PD except for the most catastrophic scenario, finding climate refugia north of the YP and deeper waters. Overall, the CNM is more pessimistic than MNM regarding forecasts. Differences between outputs could be based on the MNM using a single variable as proxy to a multivariate niche and the statistical weight of surface environmental variables in the CNM compared to MNM, which considered only bottom temperature data. In addition, coastal data may be overrepresented, which may bias the CNM. Regardless of the differences in the results, both approaches usually predicted suitability reduction in all RCP scenarios showing that temperatures of similar to 30 degrees C are detrimental for the red octopus.

While polycultures often provide valuable services, logistical constraints with planting and harvesting can hamper implementation on large scales. An alternative diversification strategy is to increase within-field intraspecific crop diversity through the use of crop varietal mixtures. Here, we evaluate an interdisciplinary body of research to determine the potential for crop varietal mixtures to support food security by providing ecological, economic, and nutritional services. Previous literature has synthesized the link between varietal mixtures and yield and insect pest suppression services. We expand on prior analyses by considering hypotheses generated from species-level research and assessing whether they also provide a useful framework for predicting how varietal mixtures affect crop productivity and insect pest suppression. In addition, we evaluate the potential for varietal mixtures to increase farm resilience and growers' profits. While there is a growing effort to quantify the economic value of ecosystem services provided by agrobiodiversity in terms of enhanced yield or revenue, much less attention has been given to quantifying the production costs associated with diversification schemes. Consequently, we know little about the effect of diversification practices on farm profitability, the metric of ultimate importance to farmers. We address this issue by evaluating the ability of varietal mixtures to reduce production costs associated with other types of agrobiodiversity and outline areas for future research to better understand the profit implications of varietal mixtures. Further, we review evidence that varieties of some crop species differ in phytochemical content-a functional trait important for insect pest suppression and human dietary diversity-suggesting that varietal mixtures could be designed to simultaneously support insect pest control and human nutrition services. Given that little research has explicitly addressed the capacity for varietal mixtures to support human nutrition, we outline predictions for where we would expect to see the greatest nutritional impact of mixtures, providing a foundation for future human nutrition research.

Field sampling conducted by the multidisciplinary, international Census of Marine Life project MAR-ECO, namely the 2004 G.O. Sars cruise, has generated one of the largest open ocean deep-pelagic sample collections ever obtained. With the overall goal of understanding carbon flow processes within and through the deep-pelagic nekton associated with the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge system (N MAR), quantitative trophic analyses were conducted in order to identify the major intraspecific patterns in diet of characteristic members of the midwater fish community, Diets of five abundant species of zooplanktivorous fishes were examined in detail in terms of prey taxonomy and variability in space, ontogeny and diel cycle. Two major patterns of feeding were identified. Pattern 1 included three species preying primarily on copepods, Argyropelecus hemigymnus, Maurolicus muelleri and Vinciguerria attenuata, the former two of which revealed spatial differences in diet with latitude, mostly likely related to latitudinal prey distributions and densities. Maurolicus demonstrated ecological differences in diet that mirrored phenotypic variation North and South of the Subpolar Front, an oceanic species concept question that warrants further research. Pattern 2 included two species feeding primarily on amphipods, Argyropelecus aculeatus and Sternoptyx diaphana, both of which showed ontogenetic variability in feeding primarily related to specific amphipod taxon sizes, rather than prey switching to other major prey taxa. This is the first study that highlights the importance of amphipods in the diets of these species. All fish species showed selectivity in prey choice, possibly related to competition with the other major nekton components along the N MAR, namely the Myctophidae and other zooplanktivorous Stomiiformes. Daily ration fell within the expected values for midwater fishes (1-4% of body weight) with the exception of S. diaphana, suggesting that this species is unique among the zooplanktivores - either its ration is three times higher than the other species, or it eats one-third as often (i.e., every 3 days). Given the high percent stomach fullness observed throughout the diel cycle, we believe the former to be the case, which is the first estimate of its kind for a midwater fish.

Alternatively, origins of alpine species may be referred to regional speciation via origins from lowland ancestors and adaptation to high altitudes. Moreover, evolutionary histories of alpine species have also been influenced by Quaternary glaciations. Range fluctuations due to climatic oscillations have caused vicariant speciation and secondary contact hybridization. However, comparative phylogenetic studies on alpine floras from mountain systems of different continents are scarce. Here we review the phylogenetic relationships of alpine species of Ranunculus, an almost cosmopolitan genus with alpine representatives in all major mountain systems of the world. Based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of 245 alpine and lowland species (based on a combined dataset of ITS, matK, trnK and psbJ-petA sequences), we try to elucidate origins of alpine buttercups. Results suggest that most major mountain systems (European Alpine System, Irano-Turanian mountains, Himalayas, Central Asian mountains, African mountains, and Andes) have been colonized multiple times independently; only the North American alpine species fall all into one clade. In the European and Irano-Turanian mountains, recruitment of alpine species from lower altitudes of the same area, and migration within the Tethyan area might have played a major role. The alpine species of the Himalayas, the Central Asian mountains, the North American alpine species and the Arctic species fall into another, distinct clade, which may suggest a northern migration route. The North American alpine clade comprises many lowland species and might have diversified via adaptive radiation. In contrast, the Himalayan species have no lowland source flora and might have originated from immigrants of the Central Asian mountains. Tropical alpine Ranunculi in the mountains of Eastern Africa and in Taiwan have originated after long-distance dispersal from other continents. The origin of the New Zealand alpines could have been referred to long-distance dispersal, probably following southern migration routes via the Antarctic and South America.

This assumption increases the risk of erroneous conclusions in assessing marine zoning, and consequently counter-productive management actions. Accordingly, it is important to understand how fishers respond to a combination of the implementation of no-take zones, and various climatic and human drivers of change. Those adaptive responses could influence the interpretation of assessment of no-take zone effectiveness, yet few studies have examined these aspects. Indeed, such analysis is often unfeasible in developing countries, due to the dominance of data-poor fisheries, which precludes full examination of the social-ecological outcomes of MPAs. In the Galapagos Marine Reserve (Ecuador), however, the availability of long-term spatially explicit fishery monitoring data (1997-2011) for the spiny lobster fishery allows such an analysis. Accordingly, we evaluated how the spatiotemporal allocation of fishing effort in this multiple-use MPA was affected by the interaction of diverse climatic and human drivers, before and after implementation of no-take zones. Geographic information system modelling techniques were used in combination with boosted regression models to identify how these drivers influenced fishers' behavior. Our results show that the boom-and-bust exploitation of the sea cucumber fishery and the global financial crisis 2007-09, rather than no-take zone implementation, were the most important drivers affecting the distribution of fishing effort across the archipelago. Both drivers triggered substantial macro-scale changes in fishing effort dynamics, which in turn altered the micro-scale dynamics of fishing patterns.

There are potential environmental and agronomic benefits to the reintroduction of native prairie warm-season grass species into grazing systems, but these benefits can only be realized if farmers are willing to use native grasses. Because of the important relationship between farmer attitudes and conservation behaviors, we assessed grass-based farmer attitudes towards and perceptions of native grasses. We held focus groups with farmers to clarify grazing terminology and concepts and then developed a written questionnaire that was reviewed by experts in the fields of applied social research, survey methodology, and farming systems before being pilot-tested on a small group of farmers. In February 2006, we mailed the questionnaire to 800 Wisconsin grass-based farmers. We created indices and used descriptive statistics to interpret the results. We show how a tool (classification tree) commonly used to analyze complex ecological data call be used to interpret Survey data. Thirty-five percent of respondents said they are interested in native grasses for pasture use. However, the large majority of farmers reported that they are unfamiliar with the identification and establishment of native grasses. The most important predictor of farmer interest in native grasses was his/her perception of how native grasses affect the environment. Both environmental and financial factors were ranked as highly important to farmers when considering the implementation of conservation projects. Our results show that environmental concerns are important to farmers and highlight the need to both improve our understanding of how native grasses affect ecosystem services and to educate farmers about native grass use and establishment.

The exceptional theoretical capacitance of CoMoO4, resulting from the presence of active cobalt ions, distinguishes it from other materials. However, the synthesis of CoMoO4 in nanostructured forms presents a challenge. This study introduces a straightforward one-pot solvothermal technique for producing ultra-small, one-dimensional (1D) rice-like CoMoO4 nanorods. The electrochemical performance of rice-like CoMoO4 nanorods as a supercapacitor electrode material was thoroughly investigated, along with larger CoMoO4 nanorods made using the hydrothermal process for comparison. The structural, morphological, and surface characteristics of the rice-like CoMoO4 nanorods were comprehensively examined. The nanorods, formed like rice grains, exhibited exceptional ability to store electric charge, with an outstanding specific capacitance of 1608.8 F g(-1). They demonstrated remarkable cycling stability, retaining 96 % of their capacitance after numerous charge and discharge cycles, indicating their durability and reliability. The nanorods also exhibited a high rate capability of 71 %, which is crucial for applications that demand quick energy delivery.

There has been a call from scientists, farmers, and activists to identify and promote the mechanisms for sustaining resilient farming livelihoods. We hypothesize that small-scale farmers who are more knowledgeable about changes in their environment are more resilient to current social -ecological changes as they might be more prepared to respond to these disturbances. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to understand how Indigenous and local knowledge on social -ecological changes is associated with small-scale farmers' livelihood resilience in the Chiloe ' Archipelago, a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System and Global Biodiversity Hotspot in southern South America. METHODS: We conducted 100 surveys with small-scale farmers whose main livelihood activity relied on agrosilvopastoral systems. By asking questions about noticed changes in the atmospheric, physical, biological, and human system, we built an Index of Knowledge on Social -Ecological Changes. We also built an Index of Livelihood Resilience based on households' information on indicators of five capital assets (i.e., financial, human, social, physical, and natural). Finally, by using general linear mixed models, we tested the association between the Index of Knowledge on Social -Ecological Changes, individual capital assets, and the Index of Livelihood Resilience. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that the level of small-scale farmers' knowledge was similar across the different systems (atmospheric, physical, biological, and human). We observed a significant positive association between the Index of Knowledge on Social -Ecological Changes and the Index of Livelihood Resilience, as well as with the natural, social, and physical capital of small-scale farmers. SIGNIFICANCE: By demonstrating the positive association between measures of Indigenous and local knowledge on social -ecological changes and indicators of livelihood resilience, our results suggest that people who are more knowledgeable about changes in their environment might be more prepared to respond to disturbances.

Species recognition is influenced by both geographical variation in song and birds' discrimination abilities, forming the basis for evolutionary processes driving reproductive isolation and speciation. Here, we assessed the behavioural responses to geographical variation in songs in olive sparrows, Arremonops rufivirgatus. We conducted a series of playback experiments in two allopatric populations (Pacific, Peninsula) to assess whether olive sparrows responded differentially to geographical variants of their song and whether such responses could be predicted by the acoustic similarity between subject and stimulus songs. Our results indicate an asymmetrical behavioural response, with the Pacific population responding strongly to both local and allopatric stimuli and weakly to the control, and the Peninsula population responding strongly to local stimuli and weakly to both allopatric stimuli and the control. Furthermore, despite the birds' lack of previous experience with the playback stimulus songs, we found that response intensity was predicted by the acoustic similarity in both populations, with stronger responses to more similar songs, suggesting that males from different population may use a similar mechanism to recognize signals, despite whether the signal comes from conspecifics or heterospecifics. Our findings support the hypothesis that song divergence could act as a premating barrier for at least one of the studies populations, and that birds' responses are dictated by the structural similarity between senders' and receivers' signals.

Much evolutionary biology assumes, implicitly or explicitly, that optimal behavioural strategies are genetically inherited, yet the behaviour of many animals depends crucially on learning. The question of how learning contributes to optimal behaviour is largely open. Here we propose an associative learning model that can learn optimal behaviour in a wide variety of ecologically relevant circumstances. The model learns through chaining, a term introduced by Skinner to indicate learning of behaviour sequences by linking together shorter sequences or single behaviours. Our model formalizes the concept of conditioned reinforcement (the learning process that underlies chaining) and is closely related to optimization algorithms from machine learning. Our analysis dispels the common belief that associative learning is too limited to produce 'intelligent' behaviour such as tool use, social learning, selfcontrol or expectations of the future. Furthermore, the model readily accounts for both instinctual and learned aspects of behaviour, clarifying how genetic evolution and individual learning complement each other, and bridging a long-standing divide between ethology and psychology. We conclude that associative learning, supported by genetic predispositions and including the oft-neglected phenomenon of conditioned reinforcement, may suffice to explain the ontogeny of optimal behaviour in most, if not all, non-human animals.

The last decade witnessed a Klondike Gold Rush era for ecological research given a growing multidisciplinary interest in EOS. Presently, the combination of repositories of remotely sensed big data, with cloud infrastructures granting exceptional analytical power, may now mark the emergence of a new paradigm in understanding spatio-temporal dynamics of ecological systems, by allowing appropriate scaling of environmental data to ecological phenomena at an unprecedented level. However, while some efforts have been made to combine remotely sensed data with (near) ground ecological observations, virtually no study has focused on multiple spatial and temporal scales over long time series, and on integrating different EOS sensors. Furthermore, there is still a lack of applications offering flexible approaches to deal with the scaling limits of multiple sensors, while ensuring high-quality data extraction at high resolution. We present GEE_xtract, an original EOS-based (Sentinel-2, Landsat, and MODIS) code operational within Google Earth Engine (GEE) to allow for straightforward preparation and extraction of remote sensing data matching the multiple spatio-temporal scales at which ecological processes occur. The GEE_xtract code consists of three main customisable operations: (1) time series imageries filtering and calibration; (2) calculation of comparable metrics across EOS sensors; (3) scaling of spatio-temporal remote sensing time series data from ground-based data. We illustrate the value of GEE_xtract with a complex case concerning the seasonal distribution of a threatened elusive bird and highlight its broad application to a myriad of ecological phenomena. Being user-friendly designed and implemented in a widely used cloud platform (GEE), we believe our approach provides a major contribution to effectively extracting high-quality data that can be quickly computed for metrics time series, converted at any scale, and extracted from ground information.

To find out to what extent policy professionals might concur with this hypothesis, and what the opportunities and obstacles to implementing socioecosystem-based policy might be, research was conducted to elicit the expert opinion of officials responsible for formulating and implementing environmental policy in Mexico.

The aim is to compare coccolithophore paleoproductivity proxies, such as C-37 alkenone concentration and nannofossil accumulation rate (NAR), and understand their relationship with paleoceanographic condition and paleoenvironmental changes, alkenone-producing precursors and unsaturated C-37 alkenone compounds. The patterns of C-37 alkenones and NAR provide reliable information on past paleoproductivity changes since coccolith dissolution and organic matter preservation were excluded as relevant processes at the site. This is testified by the high values of Nannofossil Dissolution Index and relation between C-37 alkenone concentration and Alcohol Preservation Index, the latter used as a proxy of sea bottom ventilation in the basin. A weak mismatching between NAR and C-37 alkenone concentration records has been observed and related to paleoenvironmental factors and ecological preferences of alkenone-producing species. Temperature variations mostly controlled the alternating interspecific abundance variations of these taxa through glacial-interglacial and stadial-interstadial climate phases. The percentage abundances of alkenone-producing species, Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica and Gephyrocapsa with open central area (mainly G. margerelii-G. muellerae) strongly co-varied with the percentages of C-37:2 and C-37:3, respectively during warm and cool-cold periods, suggesting their prominent role in producing these unsaturated C-37 alkenone compounds. Moreover, Gephyrocapsa spp. with open central area > 3 mu m were likely the main C-37:4 producers during the colder late MIS 20 stadial and stadial phases. Other factors in addition to temperature influenced the paleoproductivity proxy patterns. The oceanographic condition established during MIS 20-MIS 19 deglaciation and the more nutrient-rich surface waters during the orbitally-controlled organic-rich layer deposition in the early MIS 19 enhanced primary productivity leading to higher production and preservation of total C-37 alkenones.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rodrigues, Teresa/G-2912-2013; Marino, Maria/J-6868-2014","Rodrigues, Teresa/0000-0001-7811-7506; Marino, Maria/0000-0001-6239-0786; Girone, Angela/0000-0002-0064-6464",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0031-0182","1872-616X",NA,NA,NA,"SEP 1",2022,601,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"111104","10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111104","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111104",NA,"JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000820433000002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Individual preferences and requirements for heterogeneous resources can lead to differences in where behaviors take place and which kinds of individuals interact. In this study we examined whether properties of habitat patches predict presence of and interactions among wild forked fungus beetles (Bolitotherus cornutus). B. cornutus use shelf-like fruiting bodies of wood decaying fungi (brackets) as social arenas, courtship and mating sites, oviposition locations, and food sources. Brackets on a single log vary in size and condition and represent a dynamic resource as individual brackets decay over the years that they persist on a subpopulation. We found that size and condition significantly predicted how a bracket was used by B. cornutus. Both males and females were found more often on larger, living brackets. Larger brackets hosted proportionally more social interactions and mating behaviors relative to the overall visitation by individuals. The relationship between these resource properties and frequencies of behaviors was stronger for reproductive, between-sex social interactions. Live brackets also attracted more oviposition events by females, but bracket size had no effect on this behavior. Our results indicate that the dynamics of growth and aging of a critical resource can impact how social and reproductive behaviors are distributed in time and space, which in turn could affect the social structure of subpopulations. Significance statement Species that depend on critical host resources are often faced with a patchy landscape of resource quality. Those patches represent the infrastructure within which social behaviors take place, and can have formative effects on where, when, and how social interactions occur. We demonstrated that the size and condition of a fungal resource predicted male and female forked fungus beetle presence and behavior. Larger, living brackets hosted more beetles overall, while larger brackets in any condition hosted more social interactions and mating behaviors.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHAs), biodegradable biopolymers produced by microorganisms that show promise in replacing conventional plastics. The review discusses the classification, properties, and potential substrates of less studied mcl-PHAs, highlighting their greater ductility and flexibility compared to poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), a well-known but brittle PHA. The authors summarize existing research to emphasize the potential applications of mcl-PHAs in biomedicine, packaging, biocomposites, water treatment, and energy. Future research should focus on improving production techniques, ensuring economic viability, and addressing challenges associated with industrial implementation. Investigating the biodegradability, stability, mechanical properties, durability, and cost-effectiveness of mcl-PHA-based products compared to petroleum-based counterparts is crucial. The future of mcl-PHAs looks promising, with continued research expected to optimize production techniques, enhance material properties, and expand applications. Interdisciplinary collaborations among microbiologists, engineers, chemists, and materials scientists will drive progress in this field. In conclusion, this review serves as a valuable resource to understand mcl-PHAs as sustainable alternatives to conventional plastics.

Quantitative evaluations of IBIs to determine whether they can explicitly link environmental condition with anthropogenic activities are needed to effectively use them in management. Analytical approaches using supervised neural networks are potentially powerful techniques to evaluate IBIs. The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of neural networks to identify ecosystem characteristics related to IBI response and to explicitly quantify relationships between variables using sensitivity analyses. An aquatic macrophyte-based IBI developed for Minnesota lakes was used as an example. The study was particularly interested in the usefulness of neural networks to highlight key predictors of IBI performance and to be used as a technique to evaluate multimetric index performance in other systems or regions. Neural networks made accurate predictions of overall IBI scores using an independent dataset, whereas predictive performance of the models varied for individual metrics. Bootstrap analyses to evaluate the effects of different training data on model performance indicated that predictions were highly sensitive to the training data. More conventional modeling techniques, such as multiple regression, performed similarly in predicting IBI scores, although diagnostic tools developed for neural networks provided novel insight into variables influencing IBI response. We suggest that neural networks have the ability to quantify ecological relationships that affect biotic integrity, but the statistical uncertainty associated with multimetric indices may limit the use of predictive models to infer causation. Accordingly, the statistical properties of multimetric indices should be carefully evaluated during index development, with specific attention given to the diagnostic capabilities of individual metrics.

Also recorded were differences on the abundance of hydrocarbon degraders among the rhizosediment of the different plants collected at the same site (J. maritimus < P. australis < T. striata), with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between J. maritimus and T. striata. Moreover, strong positive correlations-0.81 and 0.84 (P < 0.05), between biotic (HD) and abiotic (organic matter content) parameters and TPHs concentrations were also found.

Experimental ethics, the application of scientific principles to ethical studies, provides a model for developing policies to advance solutions. A growing literature proposes evolutionary explanations for moral development. Connecting these approaches necessitates an experimental or scientific ethics that deliberately examines theories of morality for reliability. To illustrate how such an approach works, we cover three areas. The first section analyzes cross-cultural ethical systems in light of evolutionary theory. While such research is in its early stages, its assumptions entail consequences for engineering education.

One of the most important zeitgeber to time reproduction is the photoperiod, but further environmental cues are assessed to fine-tune reproduction due to year-to-year variation in environmental conditions. However, in urbanized environments, the pervasive artificial light at night has altered the natural signal of light and darkness. Accordingly, artificial light at night was repeatedly shown to affect avian reproductive physiology and to advance seasonal reproduction in birds. However, these experiments were mainly conducted in the absence of further environmental cues to facilitate the investigation of the mechanisms which are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate whether the endocrine system of free-ranging European blackbirds (Turdus merula) correlates with the amount of artificial light at night along a rural to urban gradient while the birds still encounter complementary environmental cues including seasonal variation in day length and temperature. Testosterone and estrone were assessed as metabolites in fecal samples and corticosterone in blood from mist-netted blackbirds. We demonstrate that seasonal fluctuations in abiotic factors, individual conditions, but also light at night affect the reproductive and stress physiology of wild European blackbirds. Elevated artificial night light intensities were significantly positively correlated with corticosterone and negatively with female estrone levels. No effects of artificial light were found for testosterone levels. Our results suggest that female blackbirds in particular perceive even low levels of artificial light at night as a weak but chronic stressor that interacts with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and leads to a reduced secretion of reproductive hormones.

The study took place during the autumn of 2013 and the spring and summer of 2014, and the study cases were two Mediterranean rivers (ancora and Ferreira rivers), differing in their ecological status. The biomarkers determined are widely employed and comprise a large set of biochemical responses: the activity of enzymes (cholinesterases, glutathione S-transferases, catalase and lactate dehydrogenase) and the levels of lipid peroxidation. They were assessed seasonally and in different macroinvertebrate taxa. Thirteen water physico-chemical parameters were also seasonally determined, and the concentration of seven organophosphorus pesticides and the percentage of 32 trace metals in sediments were determined in the spring. This is particularly useful for water management. Based on this, authorities can take actions to prevent further damage in the ecological status.

However, to provide ecologically relevant information, community approaches are required. The aim of this study was to causally link prometryn exposure to community-level effects in complex field situations and to identify response times of adaptation to pollution and recovery from pollution. For this reason sensitivity shifts in communities were detected and related to structural changes within the periphyton community. Furthermore, it was intended to illustrate the possibility of a combined approach of community translocation and sensitivity assessment for active monitoring of polluted sites. Periphyton was grown at a reference (R) and at a polluted (P) site of the river Elbe basin for 26 days, was subsequently transferred from the polluted site to the reference site and vice versa. Sensitivity of communities to prometryn was determined according to the pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT)-concept in short-term tests by measuring photosynthesis inhibition and was related to structural changes in algal class and diatom species composition. Exposure to prometryn was determined using polar organic integrative samplers (POCIS), giving time-weighted average concentrations. Environmental concentrations of prometryn were significantly higher at the polluted site compared to the reference site. Communities grown at the polluted site showed a higher tolerance to prometryn in comparison to the reference site. 17 Days after the translocation to the reference site, EC(50) decreased 2-fold compared to the non-translocated P-community of the same age. By contrast, EC(50) of the community grown at the reference site was 5 times higher after 17 days exposure at the polluted site. Furthermore, P-R communities were less sensitive to prometryn (higher EC(50)) than R-P communities, 24 days after translocation. These changes in sensitivity to prometryn were consistent with changes in species composition and clearly indicate that the exposure history of communities is defining the time-response of recovery and adaptation. In conclusion, the PICT-concept is shown to be a suitable tool for analysis of recovery and adaptation processes of communities under natural conditions. Therefore, it improves the link between cause and effect in field situations. In situ translocation studies provide an ecological relevant assessment of pesticide effects under field conditions and could be used as a diagnostic tool in active monitoring for decision-making frameworks as used in the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD).

The profitability of sociality, however, varies with ecological context. As ecological context varies, tension emerges among the costs and benefits of social grouping. Fission-fusion societies are fluid in their group dynamics across spatial and temporal contexts, permitting insights into how context affects whether animals choose to join or depart from a group. We tested four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses driving variation in fission and fusion in caribou, Rangifer tarandus: (1) risky places, (2) environment heterogeneity, (3) activity budget and (4) social familiarity. The risky places hypothesis predicts that animals are unlikely to diffuse when habitats are open and the risk of predation is elevated. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis predicts that fission is more likely in a heterogeneous landscape due to the rising conflicts of interest between group members. The activity budget hypothesis predicts that dyads associate by body size due to similar food passage rates. The social cohesion hypothesis predicts that familiar individuals are less likely to fission. We tested the hypotheses using time-to-event (time before fission) analyses and a linear model that assesses spatial, social and body size relationships among female caribou (N 1/4 22) on Fogo Island, Newfoundland, Canada. Contrary to our prediction for risky places, probability of fission was not influenced by habitat openness. The hypothesis of environmental heterogeneity was partially supported, as caribou remained less cohesive in environments with a higher richness of habitats. No direct evidence emerged to support the activity budget hypothesis. However, it appears that caribou maintain the strongest social bonds among variably sized individuals and that these social bonds do decrease the propensity to split. Collectively, our findings showed that social interactions may depend not only on individual identity and characteristics, but also on the spatial context in which these interactions occur.

In this perspective, we present principles and approaches to understanding the co-evolution of these interactions, with a novel focus on how genomic architecture might facilitate it.

For example, advances in genomics allow us to unravel signatures of selection in mitochondrial and nuclear OXPHOS genes at population-relevant scales, while newly published complete atomic-resolution structures of the OXPHOS machinery enable more robust predictions of how these genes interact epistatically and co-evolutionarily. We use three case studies to show how integrative approaches have improved the understanding of mitonuclear interactions in OXPHOS, namely those driving high-altitude adaptation in bar-headed geese, allopatric population divergence in Tigriopus californicus copepods, and the genome architecture of nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial functions in the eastern yellow robin.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Morales, Hernan/AAA-5966-2022; Greening, Chris/J-4408-2019; Pavlova, Alexandra/H-4749-2014","Greening, Chris/0000-0001-7616-0594; Morales, Hernan/0000-0002-2964-020X; Pavlova, Alexandra/0000-0001-9455-4124",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-8021",NA,NA,NA,"MAR 3",2017,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"25","10.3389/fgene.2017.00025","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2017.00025",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28316610,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000402717700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We observed a range of behavioral and molecular changes in Paramecium bursaria in response to microplastic exposure. These elicited changes include abnormal swimming patterns, reduced moving speed, impaired predator avoidance, and elevated oxidative stress. Overall, we demonstrated the possibility of using Paramecium bursaria as an alternative eukaryotic species for evaluating the toxicity of microplastics, which may serve as a valuable tool in the study of other environmental contaminants.

To date, toxicological assessment of MPs is predominantly dependent on metazoan animals, although their applications are sometimes limited due to the high cost, narrow ecological niche, or ethical considerations. In this regard, unicellular eukaryotes (i.e., protozoa) that are ubiquitously present in nature represent a promising alternative for evaluating the toxicity of MPs. In this study, we selected Paramecium bursaria (P. bursaria) as a representative of protozoa and further investigated behavioral and molecular changes in MPs-exposed P. bursaria. Our results showed that following MPs uptake, P. bursaria exhibited various changes, including anomalies in swimming patterns, reduction in moving speed, impairment of avoidance behavior, elevation of oxidative stress, and potential disturbance of endosymbiosis.

Here, we study the expansion of the yellow sac spider Cheiracanthium punctorium, a medically important species in Central Europe. Using microsatellite markers and DNA sequences, morphological and climate niche analyses, we identify factors associated with the spider's expansion success. Our results indicate that the species' initial expansion has been triggered by environmental change and preadaptation in the source populations. However, despite extensive gene flow, expanding populations maintain genetic and morphological differentiation from native ones, which is correlated with climatic niche differences. Moreover, expanding spiders might have temporarily escaped an eggsac parasite that causes high mortality in the native range. Hence, our results paint a complex picture of diverse factors associated with expansion success. We speculate that expanding populations might be capable of adapting to novel ecological conditions in northern Europe. This could allow a substantial range expansion, much farther than by environmental change alone.

This paper compares the performance of the established ITS1F/4B primer pair, which targets basidiomycetes, to that of two new pairs. Key factors in the comparison were the diversity covered, off-target amplification, rarefaction at different Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) cutoff levels, sensitivity of the method used to process the alignment to missing data and insecure positional homology, and the congruence of monophyletic clades with OTU assignments and BLAST-derived OTU names. The ITS primer pair yielded no off-target amplification but also exhibited the least fidelity to the expected phylogenetic groups. The LSU primers give complementary pictures of diversity, but were more sensitive to modifications of the alignment such as the removal of difficult-to align stretches. The LSU primers also yielded greater numbers of singletons but also had a greater tendency to produce OTUs containing sequences from a wider variety of species as judged by BLAST similarity. We introduced some new parameters to describe alignment heterogeneity based on Shannon entropy and the extent and contents of the OTUs in a phylogenetic tree space.

This species is an ecosystem engineer and is of great interest for commercial and restoration aquaculture. We used a multidisciplinary approach to examine acute and long-term physiological differences in O. lurida in response to in situ oceanographic conditions in a dynamic inland sea. We outplanted oysters to different areas in Puget Sound, Washington, affixing cages to anchor lines of oceanographic monitoring buoys. This allowed us to couple high-resolution oceanographic data with organism's phenotypic response. To assess spatiotemporal differences in oyster physiological performance, we collected oysters after six-months and one year of acclimatization at four field sites. During each collection period we evaluated changes in shell properties, diet, metabolism, and reproduction. Adult growth, delta 13C and delta 15N isotopic signatures, and gametogenesis were affected by both seasonal and environmental conditions. In the winter, oysters from all sites had higher respiration rates when exposed to acute thermal stress, and lower respiration response to acute pH stress. Lipid content, sex ratio and shell strength were unchanged across locations. Offspring growth rates between sites at experimental temperature 20 degrees C closely reflected parental growth rate patterns. Offspring survival was not correlated with growth rates suggesting different energetic trade-offs in oyster offspring. The metabolic response (respiration) of larvae reached its highest point at 20 degrees C but sharply decreased at 25 degrees C. This indicates that larvae are more sensitive to temperature stress, as adults did not exhibit a reduction in metabolic response at 25 degrees C.

An important finding was the very low degree of genetic differentiation among geographically distant populations (fixation index = 0.026), suggesting lack of reproductive isolation across the ocean. This feature of the Atlantic herring facilitates the detection of genetic factors affecting adaptation because of the sharp contrast between loci showing genetic differentiation resulting from natural selection and the low background noise resulting from genetic drift. We show that genetic factors associated with timing of reproduction are shared between genetically distinct and geographically distant populations. The genes for thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), the SOX11 transcription factor (SOX11), calmodulin (CALM), and estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2A), all with a significant role in reproductive biology, were among the loci that showed the most consistent association with spawning time throughout the species range. In fact, the same two SNPs located at the 5' end of TSHR showed the most significant association with spawning time in both the east and west Atlantic.

Indicators performed as follows: i) insensitive (community biomass stability, clustering coefficient), ii) varying directly (number of species going extinct) or inversely (Normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS) coefficient of determination), and iii) abrupt inverse change, but then insensitive beyond a threshold (Fishing in Balance (FiB) index, Mean Trophic Level of the Catch, NBSS slope, and total community biomass). The latter four indicators seem less informative for management once a fishery has developed. Simulations showed that fishing any single species affected several species through food web-mediated mechanisms, then making difficult to predict the effects of fishing on the abundance of target and non-target species.

In contrast to current anthropological understandings of resource-related violence, environmental conflict models are unable to take into account the social and cultural nature of resource conflicts, including the roles that social histories, symbolically-mediated perception, and local political economies play in the outbreak of violence.

But laws and regulations do not necessarily reflect what happens in practice, potentially to the detriment of communities and natural systems. Through a case study of Puerto Rico, we investigated whether water management in practice matches legislative mandates and explored potential mismatch drivers. We focused on two governance targets-equitable allocation and water use efficiency-and assessed whether they are enshrined in the law (de jure) and how they manifest in practice (de facto).

However, while UTCC may serve as a useful proxy for the benefits provided by the urban forest, it is ultimately not a direct measure. In this study, we quantified the monetary value of multiple ecosystem services (ESD) provisioned by urban forests across nine U.S. cities. Next, we examined the distributional equity of UTCC and ESD using a number of commonly investigated socioeconomic variables. Based on trends in the literature, we predicted that UTCC and ESD would be positively associated with the variables median income and percent with an undergraduate degree and negatively associated with the variables percent minority, percent poverty, percent without a high school degree, percent renters, median year home built, and population density. We also predicted that there would be differences in the relationships between each response variable (UTCC and ESD) and the suite of socioeconomic predictor variables examined because of differences in how each response variable is derived. We utilized methods promoted within the environmental justice literature, including a multi-city comparative analysis, the incorporation of high-resolution social and environmental datasets, and the use of spatially explicit models. Patterns between the socioeconomic variables and UTCC and ESD did not consistently support our predictions, highlighting that inequities are generally not universal but rather context dependent. Our results also illustrated that although the variables UTCC and ESD had largely similar relationships with the predictor variables, differences did occur between them. Future distributional equity research should move beyond the use of proxies for environmental amenities when possible while making sure to consider that the use of ecosystem service estimates may result in different patterns with socioeconomic variables of interest.

It is also a fundamental issue for agriculture, livestock production, and aquaculture. Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory is a metabolic theory that can provide insights for these applications, as it can accurately predict the response of an organism to changes in environmental conditions. However, DEB model parameters are typically estimated for the species using mean trait values, neglecting individual differences. With advancing data collection technologies, there is a growing need to leverage individual data to calibrate DEB models. In this paper, we propose a multi-tier methodology for estimating individual-specific DEB parameters based on techniques and principles of the standard DEB estimation procedure. Individual data is often not sufficiently complete, therefore we compliment it available data on organisms of the same species. To avoid estimation bias, we employ a hierarchical tier structure. Data is categorized into tiers, depending on how general it is. In each tier, only a subset of the parameters is estimated depending on available data. The estimation proceeds in a top-down approach, starting with the most general tier and culminating in the individual tier. Values obtained in previously estimated tiers are used as pseudo-data to anchor the parameter estimation. In this way, we obtain biologically sensible individual parameter estimates in an efficient manner. As a case study, we apply our methodology to a dataset that contains weight and feed intake measurements for 52 individuals of the Mertolenga cattle breed from two performance trials. We conclude that variability in the surface-specific maximum assimilation rate and the digestion efficiency is needed to accurately model the individual data.

In Portuguese estuaries, this species reaches high densities, especially in Minho estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula, Europe), potentially playing an important role in the system's ecology. In this context, the population structure, production and the habitat use of juvenile P. flesus were investigated. Sampling took place monthly, from February 2009 until July 2010 along the entire estuarine gradient (5 sampling stations distributed in the first 29 km from the river mouth, with S1 located near the river mouth, S2 inside a salt marsh, S3 in a salinity transition zone, while S4 and S5 were located in the upper estuary). Flounder's density varied significantly among sampling stations and seasons (two-way PERMANOVA: p<0.001), with the majority of the individuals being found during the spring (30.1%) and in S3 and S4 (72.6%). Males and females presented an even distribution, with a higher proportion of males observed during summer. Fish length also differed among sampling stations and seasons (two-way PERMANOVA: p<0.001), with larger fishes being found in S1 during the autumn (168.50 +/- 59.50 mm) and the smallest in S4 during the spring (33.80 +/- 3.12 mm). Size classes associated differently with environmental variables, with larger juveniles being more abundant in the downstream areas of the estuary, whereas smaller juveniles were related to higher water temperatures, suggesting a habitat segregation of P. flesus of different sizes. The fish condition of P. flesus in Minho estuary was higher than in other systems, probably due to the dominance of juveniles on the population. Also, the densities found in this estuary were up to 32 times higher than in other locations, suggesting that Minho estuary is an important nursery area for the species. The estimated secondary production of P. flesus was lower than previous studies acknowledged in the system (0.037 g.WWm(-2).year(-1)), indicating that the production estimates of this species in estuaries can vary considerably depending on of several factors such as the sampling year and strategy, population and fish size.

After 15 days of adaptation, a total collection of feces and urine was carried out for five consecutive days. Regression analyses between N intake and N in feces and urine allowed to calculate the metabolic fecal nitrogen (MFN = 2.3 g N/kg of dry matter intake-DMI) and daily endogenous urinary N (EUN = 185 mg N/kg(0.75)). Likewise, by regression analyses between consumption of nitrogen and the nitrogen balance (NB = N ingested - N excreted, mg N/kg(0.75)), a daily requirement of 514 mg N/kg(0.75) was calculated. Therefore, if food intake is unrestricted, collared peccaries require a minimum in their diet of about 5.4% crude protein on DM basis.

Propagule transport was simulated using a finite-volume advection-diffusion model to investigate the effect of dispersal vectors (tidal flow, freshwater discharge and wind), trapping agents (retention by vegetation) and seed characteristics (buoyancy) on propagule dispersal patterns. Sensitivity analysis showed that smaller propagules, like the oval-shaped propagules of Avicennia officinalis, dispersed over larger distances and were most sensitive to changing values of retention by mangrove vegetation compared to larger, torpedo-shaped propagules of Rhizophora spp. and C. tagal. Directional propagule dispersal in this semi-enclosed lagoon with a small tidal range was strongly concentrated towards the edges of the lagoon and channels. Short distance dispersal appeared to be the main dispersal strategy for all four studied species, with most of the propagules being retained within the vegetation. Only a small proportion (max. 5 %) of propagules left the lagoon through a channel connecting the lagoon with the open sea. Wind significantly influenced dispersal distance and direction once propagules entered the lagoon or adjacent channels. Implications of these findings for mangrove restoration were tested by simulating partial removal in the model of dikes around abandoned shrimp ponds to restore tidal hydrology and facilitate natural recolonisation by mangroves. The specific location of dike removal, (with respect to the vicinity of mangroves and independently suitable hydrodynamic flows), was found to significantly affect the resultant quantities and species of inflowing propagules and hence the potential effectiveness of natural regeneration.

Therefore, the objective of the current study was to investigate the underlying source-receptor system and implement an integrated monitoring approach. Suspended sediment sources within the Kharaa catchment were identified by using extensive spatially distributed sediment sampling and geochemical and isotope fingerprinting methods. On the receptor side, the ecological implications across a gradient of fine-grained sediment influx were analyzed using a distinct hyporheic zone monitoring scheme at three representative river reaches along the Kharaa River. Results of suspended sediment source monitoring show that during snowmelt runoff, riverbank and gully erosion were the dominant sources. During the summer period, upland erosion contributed a substantial share of suspended sediment. Fine-grained sediment influx proved to be the cause of habitat loss in the hyporheic zone and benthic oxygen production limitation. This combined catchment and in-stream monitoring approach will allow for a better understanding and spatially explicit analysis of the interactions of suspended sediment transport and hyporheic zone functioning.

Current strategies need integrated interdisciplinary perspectives to develop more effective measures, especially in degrading mountainous landscapes where rising sediment concentrations persist. By comparing spatio-temporal field observations and community perceptions with the Geographic Information System (GIS)-based universal soil loss equation (USLE), this study critically examined theorized erosion patterns (by USLE) in a degraded landscape (Shanko Bahir, Ethiopia) to improve soil conservation strategy development. Daily hydro-sedimentological data (showing 792 mm of rainfall leading to 3.2 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) of sediment yield) revealed mild but variable erosion patterns in 2012. Overlooking hydrology hindered the USLE's suitability for conservation planning. For instance, the median infiltration rate (33 mm h(-1)) was rarely exceeded (3.5% of events), meaning runoff-induced erosion risk were not well predicted spatio-temporally by the USLE R-factor. Conversely, heterogeneous local perspectives explicitly considered accumulated runoff, saturation (the water at the top level rests on the bottom), fertility, and gullies as drivers of erosion (black soil breaks and forms gorges). Additionally, they designated steeper mono-cropped lands as at risk (incidentally also highlighted by USLE). Observational evidence showed steeper midslope areas decreasing in topsoil depth by 14 mm, flatter downslope areas by 0.8 mm, and the mild upslope areas increasing 2 mm. Operationalizing effective soil conservation strategies will require expanding beyond (USLE-based) technical knowledge to incorporate local stakeholders and consider the main hydrological processes causing erosion in sub-humid mountainous landscapes: saturated pathways, downslope saturation, subsurface flow, and gully formation.

Using a newly developed dynamic concept, the finite-size Lyapunov exponent (FSLE), we identified Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) present in the surface flow in the channel over a 2-month observation period (August and September 2003). By comparing seabird satellite positions with LCS locations, we demonstrate that frigatebirds track precisely these structures in the Mozambique Channel, providing the first evidence that a top predator is able to track these FSLE ridges to locate food patches. After comparing bird positions during long and short trips and different parts of these trips, we propose several hypotheses to understand how frigatebirds can follow these LCSs. The birds might use visual and/or olfactory cues and/or atmospheric current changes over the structures to move along these biologic corridors.

Inclusive, comprehensive Stakeholder Identification and Mapping processes are vital for successful environmental management. This is relevant as multi-disciplinary collaboration becomes increasingly popular, and the diversity of people influenced by, or involved in, the management of most projects is greater than ever before. Understanding how relevant parties are analysed in environmental management programmes is required to enable robust and considered methodologies as well as successful, just and equitable outcomes. 2. The aim of this study was to improve the attribute mapping process, increasing transparency and ensuring representation is both comprehensive and equitable. A rapid scoping review of Scopus and Web of Science was undertaken to collate and analyse peer-reviewed, published evidence on stakeholder analysis, with a focus on the mapping processes involved in identifying stakeholders and their attributes. 3. Of the Initial 359 identified papers, 61 were included after three stages of screening. Our results indicate that there is little consistency among practitioners to ensure that Identifying and Mapping Stakeholders is representative: <20% of Case Studies (n = 9) checked the relevancy of their stakeholders after identification. Additionally, definitions at all stages of the stakeholder analysis process were inconsistent across the case studies. Fewer than half of the Case Studies included a definition of Stakeholder (n = 22) or of stakeholder analysis (n = 25). 4. Capturing a representative sample of relevant parties, without compromising on efficiency, financial or practical constraints, is difficult. Having consistent definitions for the term Stakeholders and stakeholder analysis within environmental management is an important step. Based on the scoping review, we formalise the Analysis process into six stages. 5. Through the scoping review findings, a decision support tool, MAPTkit (Mapped Attribute Profiling Toolkit) was developed to visualise the heterogeneity and representation of stakeholders across several user-determined attributes. This tool is non-prescriptive, drawing attention to potential issues with stakeholder analysis, such as misrepresentation of real--world stakeholder communities.

A comparative analysis of five small-scale Latin American shellfisheries was conducted to identify factors suggesting success and failure. In Chile, Uruguay and Mexico Co-M produced positive effects, including stabilization of landings at low levels, increase in abundance, CPUE, unit prices and revenues per unit of effort, and reduced interannual variability in several fishery indicators, particularly in landings. Co-M was successful because it was mainly bottom-up implemented and accompanied by-catch shares (spatial property rights and community quotas). By contrast, Co-M implementation was unable to prevent the collapse of the Galapagos sea cucumber fishery, as reflected by a decrease in abundance and CPUE. Negative effects were also observed in the Galapagos spiny lobster fishery during Co-M implementation. However, recovery was observed in recent years, reflected in a stabilization of fishing effort and the highest CPUE and economic revenues observed since the beginning of the Co-M implementation phase.

In rural Tanzania, natural resources are often governed locally by informal systems of traditional resource management (TRM), defined as cultural practices developed within the context of social and religious institutions over hundreds of years. However, following independence from colonial rule, centralized governments began to exercise jurisdictional control over natural resources. Following decades of mismanagement that resulted in lost ecosystem services, communities demanded change. To improve resource protection and participation in management among stakeholders, the Tanzanian government began to decentralize management programs in the early 2000s. We investigated these two differing management approaches (traditional and decentralized government) in Sonjo communities, to examine local perceptions of resource governance, management influences on forest use, and their consequences for forest and water resources. While 97% of households understood the regulations governing traditionally-managed forests, this was true for only 39% of households for government-managed forests, leading to differences in forest use. Traditional management practices resulted in improved forest condition and surface water quality.

Mechanistic studies can inform our understanding of why some individuals are more or less cooperative, as well as identify the physiological constraints imposed upon the evolution of reproductive traits. Male wire-tailed manakins (Pipra filicauda) exhibit cooperative courtship behaviors and more cooperative territory holders have been shown to exhibit higher reproductive success. To begin to understand the proximate basis of cooperative display behaviors, we conducted both an observational study and an experimental study. Because coordinated courtship displays underlie this form of cooperation, our study also examined both the hormonal and social drivers of individual variation in courtship behavior more broadly (e.g., courtship display rates). Our observational study revealed that males with higher testosterone levels performed fewer cooperative display bouts. In addition, our experimental study demonstrated that the proportion of a male's courtship displays that were cooperative decreased after being administered a testosterone-filled hormone implant. We found no relationship between an individual's courtship display effort (i.e., display rate and time spent performing courtship displays) and circulating testosterone in either study. However, more cooperative males spent a greater proportion of time performing courtship displays than did less cooperative males, suggesting that testosterone may indirectly mediate courtship display behaviors by influencing a territory holder's cooperative behavior. Overall, both our observational and experimental results suggest that reduced cooperative behavior is a cost of maintaining high levels of testosterone for territory-holding males. Lay Summary: We show that reduced cooperative behavior is a cost of high testosterone among male wire-tailed manakins. Reduced cooperative behavior is costly because more cooperative males have higher reproductive success. Males that were more cooperative also spent more time displaying. Testosterone was not related to how much time a male spent displaying nor their display rate; however, our results suggest that testosterone may indirectly mediate a male's courtship display effort by acting up their cooperative behavior.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ryder, Thomas/G-1868-2010","Ryder, Thomas/0000-0002-5517-6607; Moore, Ignacio/0000-0001-8875-8913; Vernasco, Ben/0000-0002-5561-7273",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1045-2249","1465-7279",NA,NA,NA,"MAR-APR",2020,31,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"401","410",NA,"10.1093/beheco/arz201","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arz201",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000537266400014","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Within neotropical Leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae), many lineages are plant specialists, and some have a distinct OR repertoire compared to insectivorous species. Yet, whether specialization on particular plant genera is associated with the evolution of specialized, less diverse OR repertoires has never been tested. Using targeted sequence capture, we sequenced the OR repertoires of three sympatric species of short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia), which vary in their degree of specialization on the fruits of Piper plants. We characterized orthologous vs duplicated receptors among Carollia species, and explored the diversity and redundancy of the receptor gene repertoire. At the species level, the most dedicated Piper specialist, Carollia castanea, had lower OR diversity compared to the two generalists (C. sowelli and C. perspicillata), but we discovered a few unique sets of ORs within C. castanea with high redundancy of similar gene duplicates. These unique receptors potentially enable C. castanea to detect Piper fruit odorants better than its two congeners. Carollia perspicillata, the species with the most generalist diet, had a higher diversity of intact receptors, suggesting the ability to detect a wider range of odorant molecules.

We therefore manipulated the gradients color of glare illusions and measured changes in subjective brightness of identical shape stimuli. We confirmed that the blue resulted in what was subjectively evaluated as the brightest condition, despite all colored stimuli were equiluminant. This enhanced brightness effect was observed both in a psychophysical adjustment task and in changes in pupil size, where the maximum pupil constriction peak was observed with the 'blue' converging gradients over and above to the pupil response to blue in other conditions (i.e., diverging gradients and homogeneous patches).

The Gaussian copula that characterizes the dependence structure facilitates inferences and applications in modeling spatial dependence. This construction leads to new models such as gamma or beta Markov fields with Gaussian copulas, that are used to model Poisson intensities or Bernoulli rates in hierarchical spatial analyses. The method is naturally implemented in a Bayesian framework. To illustrate our methodology, abundances of variety of gastropod species were collected as counts or presence versus absence from a network of spatial locations in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico.

A fire event occurred in spring 2011, and measurements were recorded in the first subsequent growing season, in winter. We selected 26 rocky outcrops and established three 3 x 1 m plots per outcrop. In each plot, we quantified all cactus individuals of the four species present in the area: Echinopsis aurea, Gymnocalycium bruchii, G. mostii and Parodia submammulosa. We also recorded if each individual cactus was dead or alive, and measured its size and post-fire growth. In addition, we measured the relative cover of rocks and bare soil, and the size of the rocks within a radius of 30 cm of each individual. Individual cactus survival (70-80%) did not vary among species. The highest post-fire growth was recorded in G. bruchii. For E. aurea, P. submammulosa and G. mostii, post-fire growth was negatively related to pre-fire size, suggesting that smaller individuals recovered faster than larger ones.

A group of species illustrative of this change are whales, migratory species that have played an important part in the culture and subsistence of Arctic communities for millennia. This study explores the changing human-nature interactions and whale ES governance by combining ES and interactive governance theories. A multi-method approach is applied to assess qualitatively the qualitative governability of whale ES in three Arctic coastal locations: H??sav??k in Iceland, Andenes in Norway, and Disko Bay in Greenland. Based on a literature review, stakeholder mapping, observations, and analysis of 54 semi-structured stakeholder interviews, the study finds that whale ES governance involves multiple actors with differing preferences and values and that much of it happens outside of formal institutions, necessitating inclusive approaches to improve it. The study reveals some whale ES governance deficiencies and potentials, such as a mismatch between governance scales and a need for more formal governance practices based on scientific research and stakeholder inputs. Governance frameworks were present for provisioning whale ES related to whaling, but they were lacking for non-consumptive whale ES, such as whale watching. Addressing these issues can help to direct marine resource management toward sustainability by making it more inclusive, adaptive, and reflective of stakeholder needs and values.

We use environmental and social data to assess the relative effects of key hypothesised drivers on aboveground biomass accumulation at the farm-level over ten years. We supplement this with a qualitative analysis of perspectives from local farmers and agroforestry technicians on the potential causal mechanisms of the observed social effects. We find that the material wellbeing of farmers (e.g. assets) and access to agroforestry knowledge explain as much variation in biomass as water availability. Local perspectives suggest that this is caused by the higher adaptive capacity of some farmers and their associated ability to respond to social-ecological shocks and stresses. Additionally, the variation in biomass between farms increased over time. Local perspectives suggested that this was caused by emergent exogenous and stochastic influences which cannot be reliably predicted in technical analyses and guidance. To deal with this persistent uncertainty, local perspectives emphasised the need for flexible and adaptive processes at the farm- and village-levels. The consistency of these findings across three countries suggests these findings are relevant to similar forest restoration interventions.

Maerl species distribution, density, rhodolith growth forms, and shapes vary with environmental conditions. Hydrodynamics and depth have been shown to drive morphology. Using species-specific metrics such as sphericity and branching density, as well as diameter and fractal dimension at the rhodolith level, and maerl density at the habitat level, we quantified the habitat complexity within ten maerl beds at a regional scale (along similar to 400 km of the coastline of Brittany in Western France). Using both long-term monitoring data and environmental models, we investigated how maerl habitat complexity varies among beds and which environmental conditions drive those differences.

We confirmed variations in complexity in maerl beds at the habitat and rhodolith levels at local and regional scales, which might have ecological and conservational implications for their associated biodiversity.

We created a series of predictive models to capture the patterns of boater movements across all lakes in Minnesota, USA. Informed by more than 1.3 million watercraft inspection surveys from 2014-2017, we simulated boater movements connecting 9182 lakes with a high degree of accuracy.

Lakes with high degree and betweenness centrality were more likely to be infested with an AIS than lakes with low degree (p < 0.001) and centrality (p < 0.001). On average, infested lakes were connected to 1200 more lakes than uninfested lakes. In addition, boaters that visited infested lakes were more likely to visit other lakes, increasing the risk of AIS spread to uninfested lakes.

Hence, gathering accurate and reliable information on them is urgent. Although remote sensing has demonstrated great potential in studying terrestrial ecosystems, remote sensing-based wetland forest research is still in an early stage of development. Mapping wetland forests, particularly mangrove forests, was an initial goal of this approach and is a task that still faces methodological challenges. Initially based on aerial photography only, wetland forest mapping through remote sensing underwent explosive diversification after the launching of artificial satellites in the 1970s. Later, precision in wetland forest mapping increased with the combination of hyperspectral, multispectral, and high and very high-resolution imagery. Accurate delimitation of wetland forest extent is also necessary to assess their temporal dynamics (losses, gains, and horizontal displacement). Despite the prevalence of mapping studies, current remote sensing-based research on wetland forests addresses new questions and novel aims, such as describing and predicting wetland forest attributes through mathematical modeling. Although this approach has made substantial progress in recent decades, modeling and predicting wetland forest attributes remain insufficiently explored fields of research. Combining active and passive sensors is a promising alternative to provide a more accurate picture of these communities' attributes.

In the face of ongoing climate change, determining how physiological traits structure species' ranges is especially important in tropical montane systems.

For three montane lizard species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we collect thermophysiological data from lizards in the highest elevation site of each species' distribution, and ask how well the individuals exhibiting those traits would perform across the Atlantic Forest. We use microclimatic and organism-specific models to directly relate environmental conditions to an organism's body temperature and physiological traits, and estimate measures of thermophysiological performance. Our findings demonstrate that thermophysiological constraints do not restrict montane lizards to high elevations in this system, and thus likely do not determine the warm boundaries of these montane species' distributions.

The presence of long synthetic fibres in near-bottom waters, as well as the mirroring trends in abundance among locations for water and ingested plastics, suggest that uptake from water may be occurring potentially through suspension feeding. The spatial variability in the levels of metallic elements in N. norvegicus was poorly correlated to the variability in sediments.

Pastoralists have developed flexible resource utilization strategies that enable them to cope with the high spatio-temporal resource variability typical to these areas. However, climate change in the form of decreasing mean annual precipitation accompanied by increasing variability has important consequences for rangeland productivity and thus pastoral livelihood security. Here, we use a spatial simulation model to assess impacts of changing precipitation regimes, and to identify limits of tolerance for these changes beyond which pastoral livelihoods cannot be secured. We also examine strategies to control these limits. Our results indicate that: (i) while reduced mean annual precipitation always had negative effects, increased precipitation variability can have negative, none or even positive effects, depending on the vegetation's recovery potential. (ii) Depending on income requirements there are limits of tolerance to decreases in mean annual precipitation beyond which precipitation regimes overcharge the coping capacity of the pastoral household and threaten its livelihood. (iii) There are certain strategies, in particular Increasing mobility and Diversifying income for coping with income risks from pastoralism, that allow the limits of tolerance to be shifted to a certain extent. We conclude that it is important to consider climate change and human requirements together to create appropriate climate change mitigation strategies in pastoral systems.

Based on that, the Bi2MoO6 particles/BiOBr nanosheets were ingeniously anchored onto multilayer O-functionalized Ti3C2/MMTex by the form of in-situ self-assembly via facile two-step microwave-assisted solvothermal process. Representative characterizations confirmed that Ti3C2/MMTex exhibited chemical stability and achieved transformation from surface F-terminal to O-terminal owing to the introduction of MMTex. Moreover, Ti3C2/MMTex supporter greatly decreased the accumulation and improved the morphology of Bi2MoO6/BiOBr S-scheme heterojunction.

However, regional analyses of agricultural land use typically focus on subsets of the total global network. In this paper, we seek to address the following questions: Does the globally observed scale-free property of agricultural networks hold over smaller spatial domains? Can similar properties be observed at kilometer to meter scales? Does the observed scale-free structure persist as agricultural networks evolve over the growing season? We analyze 9 intensively cultivated Landsat scenes on 5 continents with a wide range of vegetation distributions. We find that networks of vegetation fraction within the domain of each of these Landsat scenes exhibit substantial variability - but generally still possess similar scaling properties to the global distribution of agriculture. We also find similar results when comparing Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery for 3 agricultural regions in Europe, as well as in an IKONOS image of an agricultural region of China. To illustrate an application of spatial network analysis, we show an example of network disruption. We compare two networks with similar rank-size distributions that behave differently when nodes are progressively removed. We suggest that treating agricultural land cover as spatial networks can provide a straightforward way of characterizing the connectivity and evolution of complex spatial distributions of agriculture across a wide range of landscapes and at spatial scales relevant for practical agricultural applications.

Using as a model False Bay, South Africa's largest natural bay and a socio-economic hotspot, this multidisciplinary study was designed to identify possible pollution sources to a highly-urbanised coastal region, assess their effects on several biological and biogeochemical parameters, and evaluate the role of mussels in mitigating these anthropogenic inputs. We consider several sources of pollution, including nutrient loading from wastewater and river outflows, heavy metals, and aerosol deposition. We find that pollutant inputs are largely attenuated by the circulation of the bay and by the presence of filter feeders that bioaccumulate contaminants, thereby removing them from coastal waters. Our work thus emphasizes the potential for mussels and natural abiotic processes to ameliorate anthropogenic impacts, although these mitigation strategies are not without environmental risk. We recommend that such information should be included in national assessments used to develop appropriate strategies and policies for coastal environmental management and conservation.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Altieri, Katye/GWV-4512-2022; Porri, Francesca/M-4258-2017; Puccinelli, Eleonora/M-3562-2018; Altieri, Katye/M-5231-2014; Sparks, Conrad/E-2768-2018","Porri, Francesca/0000-0001-8247-4506; Fawcett, Sarah/0000-0002-0878-6496; Puccinelli, Eleonora/0000-0002-6144-6650; Altieri, Katye/0000-0002-6778-4079; Tsanwani, Mutshutshu/0000-0002-7599-0200; Sparks, Conrad/0000-0001-9721-3544; Walker, David/0000-0002-4235-1699",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1470-160X","1872-7034",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2022,139,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"108899","10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108899","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108899",NA,"MAY 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000798788000006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Generally, high plasma concentrations of the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate, a product of fat catabolism, indicate fasting, while triglycerides indicate recent feeding and fat accumulation. In recent studies of insectivorous bats, triglyceride concentration increased after feeding as expected, but beta-hydroxybutyrate also unexpectedly increased rather than decreased. An aerial-hawking foraging strategy is energetically demanding, and thus it has been hypothesized that foraging by insectivorous bats requires catabolism of stored fat. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and triglyceride concentration following feeding in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) that were temporarily housed in individual cages to prevent flight. We provided a fixed amount of food and collected blood samples at different intervals after feeding to produce variation in plasma metabolite concentrations. Plasma triglyceride concentration responded as predicted, but similar to previous studies and contrary to our prediction, when flight was eliminated plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration responded similarly to triglyceride. Thus, it is unlikely that the unexpected plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate patterns observed in previous studies were related to flight. The mechanism underlying this unexpected pattern remains unknown, but the response has been consistent in all studies to date. Thus, plasma metabolite analysis provides an effective tool for studies of nutritional status, although more work is needed to understand why insectivorous bats respond differently than other taxa.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Boyles, Justin/A-5152-2010; Willis, Craig/F-5218-2013; Baloun, Dylan/AAE-3885-2019; McGuire, Liam/CAE-8434-2022","Willis, Craig/0000-0002-0985-8607",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1522-2152","1537-5293",NA,NA,NA,"JUL 1",2019,92,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"373","380",NA,"10.1086/704080","http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704080",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31120325,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000468761100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We summarize and present an interdisciplinary synthesis of documented observations of grizzly bears in northern Manitoba from historical records from the Hudson's Bay Company Archives, published literature, direct observations, remote camera observations, government agency reports, the first author's field notes, volunteered observations, and media and social media reports. A total of 160 observations were recorded, 140 of them since 1980. Spatially, these observations all fall within the Southern Arctic, Hudson Plains, and Taiga Shield ecozones within Manitoba and span from the northern limit of Manitoba at the Nunavut border to the south shore of the Nelson River. Grizzly bears were historically present in northern Manitoba prior to 1980, though in very low numbers, but the frequency of observations has increased significantly since then. Most observations (86%) were less than 1 km from the Hudson Bay coast. Grizzly bears appear to select for open habitats and against forested ones. Reported observations, however, have been largely opportunistic, and the geographical distribution of observer efforts was uneven, so our data likely contain spatial and temporal biases. All confirmed observations were of single bears, suggesting that the present population is likely maintained by dispersal from the population to the north. Understanding grizzly bear ecology, distribution, and demographics north and west of Churchill will be critical for more accurately assessing the status and conservation needs of grizzly bears in the province.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Roth, James/IZE-2349-2023","Ellis-Felege, Susan/0000-0002-4534-0055; Barnas, Andrew/0000-0003-0990-4666; Rivet, Danielle/0000-0003-4974-9015; Fishback, LeeAnn/0000-0001-5972-8678; Roth, James/0000-0002-0296-2786; Brook, Ryan/0000-0003-1658-1607",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0004-0843","1923-1245",NA,NA,NA,"MAR",2022,75,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"105","120",NA,"10.14430/arctic74922","http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic74922",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000813934500006","View Full Record in Web of Science"
